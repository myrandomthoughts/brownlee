While freelancing he found he had an affinity for e-commerce development, and started building commercial plugins for WordPress powered e-commerce websites. With a number of both free and paid plugins under his belt Patrick worked at <a href="http://www.woothemes.com/">WooThemes</a> as a developer and <a href="http://www.woothemes.com/woocommerce/">WooCommerce</a> support ninja for a little over a year before returning to freelancing. Though that was short lived, after only a few months he is now joining the WDS team where he hopes to learn from some of the best in the industry while also bringing his own experience. Patrick is also the organizer of <a href="http://www.meetup.com/WordPressPeoria/" target="_blank">WordPress Peoria</a>, which is the local WordCamp where he resides in Cuba, IL.</p>\n<p>When Patrick is not developing with WordPress and <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>, optimizing servers, or trying to learn new web technologies, he is usually relaxing at home with his wife and two dogs. Relaxing usually involves some casual video games and grilling/smoking various meats.</p>\n<p>We are happy to bring Patrick on board and we can&#8217;t wait to see what assets he will bring the team!</p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:69:"http://webdevstudios.com/2014/02/25/wds-welcomes-patrick-garman/feed/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"1";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:84:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\n		";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:5:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:30:"WDS At WordCamp St. Louis 2014";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:66:"http://webdevstudios.com/2014/02/24/wds-at-wordcamp-st-louis-2014/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:75:"http://webdevstudios.com/2014/02/24/wds-at-wordcamp-st-louis-2014/#comments";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 24 Feb 2014 17:54:38 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:15:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:10:"BuddyPress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:18:"Community Projects";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Facebook";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7:"General";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Team";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:5;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7:"Twitter";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:6;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"WordCamp";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:7;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9:"WordPress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:8;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:16:"WordPress Meetup";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:9;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:10:"Conference";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:10;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7:"sponsor";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:11;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"team";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:12;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3:"WDS";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:13;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"WebDevStudios";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:14;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:17:"WebDevStudios.com";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:32:"http://webdevstudios.com/?p=8068";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:411:"This year at WordCamp St. Louis, Brian Messenlehner will be speaking, Sarah Pressler will be volunteering, and Cristina Cannon will be in attendance!

Whether you’re a novice WordPress user or an experienced web developer you can leverage WordPress in many non-traditional ways. We will go over how to rapidly build scalable and secure applications and how to save time and money doing so. We will also showcase some really cool applications and examples of building things with WordPress while thinking out of the box.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Along with presenting and volunteering, WebDevStudios is <a href="http://2014.stlouis.wordcamp.org/sponsors/">sponsoring</a> WordCamp St. Louis this year!

She has been freelancing full-time since 2009, is an active member of the Aurora WordPress Meetup Group and attends WordCamps every chance she gets.</p>\n<p>Stacy&#8217;s web design career began in 2002 at a small creative agency which focused on web design and video production. She was originally hired as a print designer, but they needed more help in web, so she began to do both. At the agency, Stacy was in charge of many aspects of designing a website including creating the initial concept, carrying it out in a visual design, converting PSDs to html/css and building out a full html website (at the time when her company didn&#8217;t use a CMS). As her skills began to develop, she found herself wanting to learn more. Stacy believes she is a kick ass designer. As she has grown in her profession she has realized she REALLY enjoys the actual development of the site and thinks the problem solving aspect is a fun challenge.

She made the switch to full-time WordPress based employment in 2012 with v 3.4 (Green). Like most in the community, what started as a personal hobby has become a career that she loves. As WordPress has grown and matured over the years so has their relationship. From &#8220;Mommy Blogger&#8221; to Technical Project Manager, WordPress has been a central theme. As a mom of four, ranging from ten &#8211; sixteen, project management comes naturally. With training as a classical ballerina and an education in technical writing, the details and execution of well structured project solutions is near and dear to her heart. Client advocacy and customer support have been part of her work ethic since the high school days checking groceries at the hometown store.</p>\n<p>When off the clock and not blowing up Twitter Sarah enjoys life by the lake in Texas. Between school performances and bedtimes she likes to do things that are EXCITING and FUN!! Color Me RAD 5K&#8217;s, Kayaking, old book stores, and hippie little joints in Austin are all places she can be found. Sarah likes to visit new places, never met a road-trip that didn&#8217;t SOUND like a good idea, and never met a stranger. She&#8217;s a lover of fuzzy socks, soft warm blankets straight from the dryer, and micro brewed nutty browns.</p>\n<p>We are proud to welcome Sarah to the team, and excited about the abilities that she will bring to WebDevStudios!</p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:69:"http://webdevstudios.com/2014/02/03/wds-welcomes-sarah-pressler/feed/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"2";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:60:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\n		";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:5:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:55:"Brian Messenlehner Is Speaking At WordCamp Norway 2014!";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:91:"http://webdevstudios.com/2014/01/22/brian-messenlehner-is-speaking-at-wordcamp-norway-2014/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:100:"http://webdevstudios.com/2014/01/22/brian-messenlehner-is-speaking-at-wordcamp-norway-2014/#comments";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 22 Jan 2014 17:45:35 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:7:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7:"General";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7:"Plugins";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:27:"Social Network Applications";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Team";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"WordCamp";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:5;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9:"WordPress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:6;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:16:"WordPress Meetup";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:32:"http://webdevstudios.com/?p=8020";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:397:"Brian is taking a trip across the ocean to speak at WordCamp Norway this year!

There&#8217;s lots for you, too.</p>\n<p><strong>Please test your plugins and themes!</strong> There&#8217;s a lot of great stuff under the hood in 3.9 and we hope to blog a bit about them in the coming days. If you haven&#8217;t been reading the awesome <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/week-in-core/">weekly summaries</a> on the <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/">main core development blog</a>, that&#8217;s a great place to start. (You should definitely follow that blog.) For now, here are some things to watch out for when testing:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>load process in multisite</strong> got rewritten. If you notice any issues with your network, see <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/27003">#27003</a>.</li>\n<li>We now use the <strong>MySQL Improved (mysqli) database extension</strong> if you&#8217;re running a recent version of PHP (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/21663">#21663</a>). Please test your plugins and see that everything works well, and please make sure you&#8217;re not calling <code>mysql_*</code> functions directly.</li>\n<li><strong>Autosave</strong> was refactored, so if you see any issues related to autosaving, heartbeat, etc., let us know (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25272">#25272</a>).</li>\n<li>Library updates, in particular Backbone 1.1 and Underscore 1.6 (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/26799">#26799</a>).

It’s even open source, just like WordPress.</p>\n<h3>Refined contrast</h3>\n<p>We think beautiful design should never sacrifice legibility. With superior contrast and large, comfortable type, the new design is easy to read and a pleasure to navigate.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 class="aligncenter">WordPress on every device</h2>\n<p><img class="alignright  wp-image-2984" alt="responsive" src="http://i2.wp.com/wpdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/responsive.jpg?resize=255%2C255" data-recalc-dims="1" />We all access the internet in different ways. Smartphone, tablet, notebook, desktop — no matter what you use, WordPress will adapt and you’ll feel right at home.</p>\n<h3>High definition at high speed</h3>\n<p>WordPress is sharper than ever with new vector-based icons that scale to your screen. By ditching pixels, pages load significantly faster, too.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 class="aligncenter">Admin color schemes to match your personality</h2>\n<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2954" alt="colors" src="http://i0.wp.com/wpdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/colors.jpg?resize=623%2C339" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>\n<p>WordPress just got a colorful new update.

Or want more information? Click to discover more. Then sit back and use your keyboard’s navigation arrows to flip through every theme you’ve got.</p>\n<h3>Smoother widget experience</h3>\n<p>Drag-drag-drag. Scroll-scroll-scroll. Widget management can be complicated. With the new design, we’ve worked to streamline the widgets screen.</p>\n<p>Have a large monitor? Multiple widget areas stack side-by-side to use the available space. Using a tablet? Just tap a widget to add it.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 class="aligncenter">Twenty Fourteen, a sleek new magazine theme</h2>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2789" alt="The new Twenty Fourteen theme displayed on a laptop. tablet and phone" src="http://i0.wp.com/wpdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/twentyfourteen.jpg?resize=692%2C275" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>\n<h3>Turn your blog into a magazine</h3>\n<p>Create a beautiful magazine-style site with WordPress and Twenty Fourteen.

This release features some of the most important architectural updates we&#8217;ve made to date. Here are the big ones:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Updates while you sleep</strong>: With WordPress 3.7, you don&#8217;t have to lift a finger to apply maintenance and security updates. Most sites are now able to automatically apply these updates in the background. The update process also has been made even more reliable and secure, with dozens of new checks and safeguards.</li>\n<li><strong>Stronger password recommendations</strong>: Your password is your site&#8217;s first line of defense. It&#8217;s best to create passwords that are complex, long, and unique. To that end, our password meter has been updated in WordPress 3.7 to recognize common mistakes that can weaken your password: dates, names, keyboard patterns (123456789), and even pop culture references.</li>\n<li><strong>Better global support</strong>: Localized versions of WordPress will receive faster and more complete translations. WordPress 3.7 adds support for automatically installing the right language files and keeping them up to date, a boon for the many millions who use WordPress in a language other than English.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For developers there are lots of options around how to control the new updates feature, including allowing it to handle major upgrades as well as minor ones, more sophisticated date query support, and multisite improvements. As always, if you&#8217;re hungry for more <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.7">dive into the Codex</a> or browse the <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;group=resolution&amp;milestone=3.7">over 400 closed tickets on Trac</a>.</p>\n<h3>A New Wave</h3>\n<p>This release was led by Andrew Nacin, backed up by Dion Hulse and Jon Cave. This is our first release using the new plugin-first development process, with a much shorter timeframe than in the past. (3.6 was released in August.) The 3.8 release, due in December, will continue this plugin-led development cycle that gives much more autonomy to plugin leads and allows us to decouple feature development from a release. You can follow this grand experiment, and what we&#8217;re learning from it, <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/">on the make/core blog</a>.

While learning how to build a custom content management system, he stumbled upon WordPress and started fiddling around with it to learn more about its features. At the age of 14, he landed his first client. WordPress ticked all the boxes for the client&#8217;s requirements and Sunny launched his career as a professional WordPress developer.</p>\n<div id="attachment_19010" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Photo.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[19002]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Photo-300x249.jpg" alt="Sunny Ratilal" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Sunny Ratilal<br /></p></div>\n<p>Fast forward to three years later, Sunny is now 17 years old and currently in Sixth Form in London. When not busy studying, he enjoys developing custom plugins for clients and is also a prolific contributor to <a href="https://easydigitaldownloads.com" target="_blank">Easy Digital Downloads</a>, having logged an impressive <a href="https://github.com/easydigitaldownloads/Easy-Digital-Downloads/commits?author=sunnyratilal" target="_blank">1,097 commits</a> to the codebase.</p>\n<h3>Learning By Contributing to Open Source Projects</h3>\n<p>While contributing to EDD, Sunny said he has learned a great deal about working in remote teams. &#8220;Working alongside EDD developers, we&#8217;re scattered all around the World!  Some are based in the US, England and even New Zealand! Remote teams are fantastic because it always means someone is around whatever time of the day.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Getting involved in EDD changed Sunny&#8217;s life and opened him up to a new world of collaboration. &#8220;<span class="pullquote alignleft">Open source software has empowered me to code</span>,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Contributing to EDD was my first open source project which gave me confidence to contribute to other smaller plugins and then eventually WordPress Core, submitting my first patch to WordPress last year.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Since his first foray into commercial products involved building extensions for a popular plugin, I asked Sunny if he has any advice to others who want to be successful in that space. He said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Don&#8217;t build the extension because it&#8217;s something that&#8217;s required, build it because you want to build it. Build something you&#8217;re really passionate about; that&#8217;s what&#8217;ll give you the most pleasure whilst coding it. The key to success is not all about marketing the plugin, it&#8217;s about how the plugin is written.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Sunny advises developers to keep it clean and simple. He offered five tips for building extensions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Write clean code</li>\n<li>Document it very well</li>\n<li>Make the code efficient, don&#8217;t have hundreds of WP_Query instances or load hundreds of JavaScript/CSS files.</li>\n<li>Don&#8217;t give the customers a chance to complain, have a feature list built and always beta test</li>\n<li>Provide excellent support to all customers</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>The Importance of WordPress Role Models</h3>\n<p>While learning and working with WordPress, Sunny said that having good role models inspired him to further develop his skills. &#8220;I have three very important role models: all three are fellow WordPress developers: <a href="http://tommcfarlin.com/" target="_blank">Tom McFarlin</a>, <a href="http://pippinsplugins.com/" target="_blank">Pippin Williamson</a> and <a href="http://markjaquith.com/" target="_blank">Mark Jaquith</a>,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;They are exceptional developers who have a myriad of knowledge. <span class="pullquote alignleft">The plugins/themes they create are made with other developers in mind and their coding is by far some of the best you will ever see.</span>&#8221;</p>\n<p>Sunny is hoping to advance his skills along the same path he&#8217;s seen forged by the aforementioned developers. &#8220;I can say with a great amount of certainty that you can learn something new from every single commit to plugins/themes/WordPress Tom, Mark and Pippin make.&#8221; As is the case in many technical professions, Sunny has learned the most by doing and by watching other high performing developers.</p>\n<h3>A Bright Future for Sunny Ratilal</h3>\n<p>What does the future hold for Sunny Ratilal? He&#8217;s got one more year before entering university. Meanwhile, he is studying Mathematics, Further Mathematics, Computer Science and Physics. He hopes to study Computer Science at University.</p>\n<p>He also plans to continue his work with EDD and WordPress. At the moment, he&#8217;s taking a break from EDD contributions to focus on his schoolwork. Pursuing a career in WordPress is something he&#8217;s considered, and he plans to continue developing while getting his education. &#8220;I love building WordPress plugins and themes and have no intention to stop doing so,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>In many ways Sunny Ratilal seems ahead of his time, with his mature knowledge of teamwork, building software and handling customers. Code mentors have made all the difference for him and his experiences highlight the importance of solid role models in the WordPress community.</p>\n<p>Though you may often feel like you&#8217;re working alone in your small corner of the world, the quality of the code you produce and your interactions with other developers may actually be mentoring future WordPress professionals. A developer who works to help others learn and grow can be instrumental in swinging the doors open for newcomers to the WordPress community.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 14 Mar 2014 22:11:58 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"Matt: Shaer on Taibbi";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ma.tt/?p=43660";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:37:"http://ma.tt/2014/03/shaer-on-taibbi/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:200:"<p><a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/03/matt-taibbi-on-wall-street-first-look-media.html">Raging Against Hacks With Matt Taibbi</a>.

If you want the fonts to work over both SSL and non-SSL, you need to use the <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1808" target="_blank">protocol relative link</a>.</p>\n<p>For example, if you&#8217;re loading Google fonts from your theme&#8217;s <em>functions.php</em> file, you might do it like this:</p>\n<pre class="brush: php; light: true; title: ; notranslate">function mytheme_enqueue_styles() {\n            wp_register_style(''googleFonts'', ''http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Copse'');\n            wp_enqueue_style( ''googleFonts'');\n        }</pre>\n<p>However, this method breaks over HTTPS, which means that all your fancy custom fonts won&#8217;t work and the browser&#8217;s default will be loaded instead, ie. Times New Roman.</p>\n<p>Removing the &#8220;http&#8221; protocol from the link will allow the visitor&#8217;s browser to determine the correct protocol to load.</p>\n<pre class="brush: php; light: true; title: ; notranslate">function mytheme_enqueue_styles() {\n            wp_register_style(''googleFonts'', ''//fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Copse'');\n            wp_enqueue_style( ''googleFonts'');\n        }</pre>\n<p>There are many tutorials that claim to show you &#8220;The Right Way to Load Google Fonts in WordPress,&#8221; but most of them don&#8217;t use the protocol relative link. If you&#8217;ve ever forced SSL on pages then you know that all of your assets, including images, CSS, JS, fonts, etc., will be broken unless they are loaded via HTTPS. You should use the protocol relative links wherever possible when the assets or third-party links are available via both HTTP and HTTPS.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 14 Mar 2014 06:19:11 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:38:"WPTavern: Take The 2014 bbPress Survey";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=18954";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:120:"http://wptavern.com/take-the-2014-bbpress-survey?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=take-the-2014-bbpress-survey";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1652:"<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/BuddyCampMiami2013.jpeg" rel="prettyphoto[18954]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/BuddyCampMiami2013.jpeg" alt="BuddyCamp Miami 2013" width="194" height="259" class="alignright size-full wp-image-18957" /></a>Similar to BuddyPress, bbPress has <a href="http://bbpress.org/blog/2014/03/2014-bbpress-survey/" title="http://bbpress.org/blog/2014/03/2014-bbpress-survey/">announced its own survey</a> to help decide features and which direction bbPress development will go in 2014.

High quality CC-licensed images are incredibly easy to find these days. The vast majority of the collections include images that fall under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/deed.en" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution-Sharealike 2.0 license</a>.

At first it seemed odd to me that they wouldn&#8217;t be compatible, given that they both offer so much freedom.</p>\n<p>Samuel &#8220;Otto&#8221; Wood explained why certain Creative Commons licenses are not compatible in <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/creative-commons-verses-gpl?replies=18#post-2981463" target="_blank">an answer</a> on the WordPress.org support forums:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Because CC-BY-SA cannot be sublicensed, then that means it cannot be distributed in a work under the terms of the GPL. So it cannot be included in a GPL-compatible work-as-a-whole.</p></blockquote>\n<p>If you want to include images in a GPL-licensed work, you&#8217;ll need to select from those that fall under a <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#GPLCompatibleLicenses" target="_blank">compatible license</a>.</p>\n<p>According to the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#CC0" target="_blank">GNU licensing classifications</a>, CC0 is the only Creative Commons license that is compatible with the GPL:</p>\n<blockquote><p>CC0 is a public domain dedication from Creative Commons. A work released under CC0 is dedicated to the public domain to the fullest extent permitted by law. If that is not possible for any reason, CC0 also provides a lax, permissive license as a fallback. Both public domain works and the lax license provided by CC0 are compatible with the GNU GPL.</p></blockquote>\n<p>If you are distributing a GPL-licensed product with images, such as a WordPress theme or plugin, your best bet is to opt for using images with the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/choose/zero/" target="_blank">CC0</a> or Public Domain license.</p>\n<h3>13 High Quality Sources for CC0 and Public Domain Licensed Images</h3>\n<p><a href="http://directory.fsf.org/wiki/License:CC0" target="_blank">CC0</a> and Public Domain licensed images are not as easy to find as those that fall under the CC 2.0 license. Nevertheless, I was able to locate 13 high quality sources for finding images that are suitable for inclusion in GPL-licensed works. All of the following sites explicitly state a Public Domain or CC0 license for the images collected.</p>\n<h3><a href="http://unsplash.com/" target="_blank">Unsplash</a></h3>\n<p><a href="http://unsplash.com/"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/unsplash1.jpg" alt="unsplash" width="1500" height="1000" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18935" /></a></p>\n<h3><a href="http://www.publicdomainpictures.net/" target="_blank">PublicDomainPictures</a></h3>\n<p><a href="http://www.publicdomainpictures.net/"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/publicdomainpictures.jpg" alt="publicdomainpictures" width="1280" height="842" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18928" /></a></p>\n<h3><a href="http://pixabay.com/" target="_blank">Pixabay</a></h3>\n<p><a href="http://pixabay.com/"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/pixabay.jpg" alt="pixabay" width="1280" height="853" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18930" /></a></p>\n<h3><a href="http://splitshire.com/" target="_blank">SplitShire</a></h3>\n<p><a href="http://splitshire.com/"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/SplitShire.jpg" alt="SplitShire" width="1280" height="853" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18932" /></a></p>\n<h3><a href="http://www.1millionfreepictures.com/" target="_blank">1 Million Free Pictures</a></h3>\n<p><a href="http://www.1millionfreepictures.com/"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1millionfreepictures.jpg" alt="1millionfreepictures" width="1280" height="850" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18934" /></a></p>\n<h3><a href="http://viintage.com/" target="_blank">Viintage</a></h3>\n<p><a href="http://viintage.com/"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/vintage.jpg" alt="vintage" width="760" height="598" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18936" /></a></p>\n<h3><a href="http://www.gratisography.com/" target="_blank">Gratisography</a></h3>\n<p><a href="http://www.gratisography.com/"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/gratisography.jpg" alt="gratisography" width="1280" height="859" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18938" /></a></p>\n<h3><a href="http://littlevisuals.co/" target="_blank">Little Visuals</a></h3>\n<p><a href="http://littlevisuals.co/"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/littlevisuals.jpg" alt="littlevisuals" width="1280" height="853" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18939" /></a></p>\n<h3><a href="http://www.pdpics.com/" target="_blank">PDpics</a></h3>\n<p><a href="http://www.pdpics.com/"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/pdpics.jpg" alt="pdpics" width="640" height="426" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18941" /></a></p>\n<h3><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/britishlibrary/" target="_blank">The British Library</a></h3>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/britishlibrary/"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/britishlibrary.jpg" alt="britishlibrary" width="800" height="568" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18943" /></a></p>\n<h3><a href="http://nos.twnsnd.co/" target="_blank">New Old Stock</a></h3>\n<p><a href="http://nos.twnsnd.co/"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/nos.jpg" alt="nos" width="1000" height="724" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18945" /></a></p>\n<h3><a href="http://pickupimage.com/" target="_blank">Pickup Image</a></h3>\n<p><a href="http://pickupimage.com/"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/A-lake-near-the-base-of-Copahue-volcano-031214D6BC845BA9.jpg" alt="-A-lake-near-the-base-of-Copahue-volcano-031214D6BC845BA9" width="960" height="720" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18947" /></a></p>\n<h3><a href="http://publicdomainarchive.com/" target="_blank">Public Domain Archive</a></h3>\n<p><a href="http://publicdomainarchive.com/"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/publicdomainarchive.jpg" alt="publicdomainarchive" width="1000" height="563" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18948" /></a></p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll want to bookmark these sites for the next time you&#8217;re building a WordPress theme or plugin for distribution on WordPress.org.

Specifically, the Matrix style Easter egg which appeared when a post revision was compared to itself. It wasn&#8217;t long after the discussion when plugins started showing up on the repository to <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/disable-matrix-easter-egg/" title="https://wordpress.org/plugins/disable-matrix-easter-egg/">disable it</a>.</p>\n<p><span class="embed-youtube"></span></p>\n<p>A few days ago, Fred Myer of WPShout.com <a href="http://wpshout.com/wordpress-core-needs-writing-style-guide/" title="http://wpshout.com/wordpress-core-needs-writing-style-guide/">published his idea</a> to create a WordPress writing style guide. He describes how some error messages in WordPress are written tongue-in-cheek without providing any useful information as to why the error occurred. Take the default 404 error message in WordPress for example:</p>\n<blockquote><p>This is somewhat embarrassing, isn’t it? It seems we can’t find what you’re looking for. Perhaps searching can help.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It&#8217;s embarrassing that WordPress couldn&#8217;t find what I was looking for and then proceeds to tell me that searching can help. Maybe a search should happen automatically with a list of results in the content area of the page? Regardless, it&#8217;s the wording of the message that rubs some people the wrong way. Myer advocates a more helpful approach:</p>\n<blockquote><p>When software breaks, it should not impose emotions, like an imaginary shared experience of embarrassment, on the user. It should explain what went wrong in as much detail as is helpful, and alert the user to any resources that may help address the problem.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Myer mentions the default post content in WordPress makes it seem trivial and cheap. He suggests the text should be eloquent and reflect the foundational mission of WordPress.</p>\n<p>The personality of WordPress runs deep. From core committ messages to hidden Easter eggs to the inclusion of Hello Dolly, WordPress is not your typical piece of boring software. According to Myer:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Words have power: power to define new users’ impression of the seriousness of WordPress and its creators; power to alleviate users’ frustration or aggravate it; power to provide information or smugly withhold it. WordPress’s current written content sporadically disregards that power, making WordPress seem like a cheaper, more irritating, and less well-executed project than it really is.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I don&#8217;t have a problem with WordPress&#8217; personality but if changes could be made so that translations are easier and error messages become helpful, I&#8217;d support them. Matt Mullenweg <a href="http://wpshout.com/wordpress-core-needs-writing-style-guide/#comment-264374" title="http://wpshout.com/wordpress-core-needs-writing-style-guide/#comment-264374">commented on the article</a> and his remarks indicate that a change in WordPress’ wording isn’t likely.</p>\n<blockquote><p>WP has always been opinionated software with a lot of personality. Every year or two people try to neuter it, remove a bit of its soul, and sometimes it gets through. There are always convincing reasons, like this post, but it’s sad nonetheless. If anyone is going to stop using the software over these we probably didn’t create something very compelling in the first place. You could also create a “dry” localization of the software and see if it gets much traction.</p></blockquote>\n<div id="attachment_18909" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/HowdyDoodyFeaturedImage.png" rel="prettyphoto[18879]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/HowdyDoodyFeaturedImage.png" alt="Howdy Doody Featured Image" width="639" height="200" class="size-full wp-image-18909" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">photo credit: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23748404@N00/2292044151/">A.Currell</a> &#8211; <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/">cc</a></p></div>\n<p>No one is advocating for the demise of WordPress or telling people to stop using it over the howdy-doody verbiage within the software. There&#8217;s also not a mass exodus of people leaving the project over it. If anything, Myer&#8217;s article highlights the fact that WordPress can still be cute and funny as long as the verbiage is straight forward.</p>\n<p>I wonder how long the clash between software personality and straight forward thinking will continue? It&#8217;s been part of WordPress for years but WordPress has yet to cave in to the demands of the vocal minority. WordPress is being used on 20% of the web and continues to grow without showing any signs of slowing down. It&#8217;s not the end of the world if the verbiage of error messages and default post content are not changed but if they can be improved, then why not do it?</p>\n<h3>How To Help With The Style Guide</h3>\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to get involved with creating a WordPress writing style guide, <a href="http://wpshout.com/contact/" title="http://wpshout.com/contact/">get in touch with Fred Myer at fred at pressupinc.com</a>.

The prospect of building feature-rich, interactive stories within WordPress, without having to touch any code, was so promising that the project&#8217;s <a href="https://aesop.crowdhoster.com/storytelling-engine" target="_blank">Crowdhoster campaign</a> was <a href="http://wptavern.com/aesop-wordpress-storytelling-plugin-is-now-fully-funded" target="_blank">fully-funded</a> by the end of January.</p>\n<p>The buzz around the Aesop plugin proved that the art of storytelling is not dead. Publishers are eager to have more tools at their disposal to create stories that capture readers&#8217; attention. While Aesop brings a user-friendly implementation of storytelling features into the WordPress admin, the task of theming the plugin remained a real obstacle.</p>\n<p>Haskins had originally hoped to focus on the hosted version of Aesop after getting funded, but he temporarily scrapped that plan in favor of getting the plugin ready for showtime. Now that Aesop is available on <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/aesop-story-engine/" target="_blank">WordPress.org</a>, Haskin&#8217;s team is moving full steam ahead to develop themes that will bring the plugin to life.</p>\n<h3>Genji: A Lean WordPress Theme With Just 2 Files</h3>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/genji1.png" rel="prettyphoto[18843]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/genji1-300x279.png" alt="genji1" width="300" height="279" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-18874" /></a>The first official theme for Aesop is now in the wild. Inspired by <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/projects/2012/snow-fall/" target="_blank">NY Times Snowfall</a>, the <a href="http://nickhaskins.co/products/genji/" target="_blank">Genji</a> theme was designed to load quickly and keep the spotlight on the story.</p>\n<p>Haskin&#8217;s team aimed for simplicity with their first product. <a href="http://aesopthemes.com/genji/" target="_blank">Genji</a> loads only two files. It includes a handful of options for uploading a logo and changing the background, text and link colors. All of the magic, however, is powered by the media that users add via the story engine.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/genji2.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[18843]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/genji2-300x192.jpg" alt="genji2" width="300" height="192" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-18876" /></a>With the first product released, the  team is focusing on Jorgen, the next theme on deck for the story engine. Jorgen will incorporate the &#8220;cover&#8221; feature found on the Aesop Story Engine <a href="http://playground.aesopstories.com/" target="_blank">demo site</a>. The development team has received many requests for the theme behind the story engine demo site and they are currently working on making that available to the public.</p>\n<p>All future Aesop themes will be sold on ThemeForest, as Haskins is now <a href="http://aesopstories.com/themes/the-release-of-genji/" target="_blank">partnering with Envato</a> to make it easy for consumers to find themes for the plugin.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 13 Mar 2014 09:52:52 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:10;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:25:"Gravatar: Mobile Friendly";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://blog.gravatar.com/?p=503";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:52:"http://blog.gravatar.com/2014/03/13/mobile-friendly/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:540:"<p>We just made the Gravatar.com website, blog, and all profile pages friendlier towards mobile devices.

If the visitor is not capable of inspecting the code with his browser, he might resort to a service built to automatically detect theme details. This has resulted in a proliferation of websites and browser add-ons that detect this information.</p>\n<p><a href="http://whattheme.com/" target="_blank">What Theme</a> is a new service that detects WordPress, Ghost and Shopify templates, even if the site is not using a commercial theme. For example, if you search WP Tavern, you&#8217;ll find that our site is using the Stargazer theme:</p>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/what-theme-example.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[18827]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/what-theme-example.jpg" alt="what-theme-example" width="768" height="440" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18835" /></a></p>\n<p>It does not yet reliably pick up on WordPress child themes, as I&#8217;ve discovered in this instance and a few others.</p>\n<h3>How What Theme Works</h3>\n<p>The engine itself is built on top of WordPress and in just a few weeks it has completed over 13,000 searches across over 4,000 unique sites. What Theme co-founder Jonny Schnittger gave us the details on how it works. &#8220;The current version of WhatTheme integrates with WordPress like a theme or plug-in would,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It gives us a lot of detail regarding what people are looking for and how successful they were.&#8221;</p>\n<p>When a user searches for a site, What Theme checks its existing catalog and if it finds it, the results are returned instantly. &#8220;In this scenario we attempt to identify the theme using several different methods,&#8221; Schnittger said. &#8220;At this point we also gather a bunch of other information that we are currently not surfacing/using).&#8221; Once the engine has found the name, it attempts to identify across various catalogs and sites. &#8220;Sometimes we get multiple matches,&#8221; he said. &#8220;In this case we try and evaluate the best match and direct the user to it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>When What Theme fails to identify a theme, Schnittger said they use various pattern matching algorithms to suggest themes from the same category, such as blog, portfolio, food, etc.</p>\n<p>For example, if you search for &#8220;WordPress.com,&#8221; the engine fails to match it to a theme:</p>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/what-theme-fail.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[18827]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/what-theme-fail.jpg" alt="what-theme-fail" width="624" height="432" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18845" /></a></p>\n<p>As you can see, What Theme also offers an option for the visitor to sign up to be emailed when the theme is found. It also funnels you to its <a href="http://whattheme.com/top-themes/blog/" target="_blank">top selections</a> for themes in the &#8220;blog&#8221; category, all of which are Themeforest items with the What Theme affiliate ID. In the future, Schnittger hopes to expand the suggestions, based on fonts, colors and layout.</p>\n<h3>What Theme Plans to Expand to a WordPress Installation and Customization Service</h3>\n<p>What Theme currently has basic support for Drupal and Joomla and plans to expand to include more CMS&#8217;s, such as ModX, DotNetNuke, Umbraco, etc. They are working to improve the accuracy of results for all supported platforms.</p>\n<p>Co-founder Catalin Zorzini let us in on some of their long-term goals. <strong>&#8220;We plan to become the go-to resource for web designers and developers being asked by friends and relatives to build a website for them on the cheap or for free,&#8221;</strong> he said. &#8220;So instead of being forced to say no or to make empty promises, now they can just send them to whattheme.com and we&#8217;ll take care of the rest.&#8221; What Theme will then ask them what site they would like theirs to look like and recommend an existing template based on that. &#8220;The next step is to integrate it with a WP install and customization service,&#8221; Zorzini said.</p>\n<p>The What Theme site is another interesting take on services aimed at capitalizing on the millions of people searching for WordPress themes. Many services, such as <a href="http://wptavern.com/theme-friendly-helps-you-find-the-perfect-wordpress-theme" target="_blank">Theme Friendly</a>, are built around helping users shop for WordPress themes, with the primary monetization in the form of affiliate links.</p>\n<p>What Theme is different in that it hooks into the fact that the consumer has already located a theme that he likes. The long-term strategy for building a customization service as an offshoot of the theme search seems to be more promising than depending on affiliate links for income. What do you think about the <a href="http://whattheme.com/" target="_blank">What Theme</a> search engine? Will they be able to leverage the traffic into a successful WordPress business?</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 12 Mar 2014 23:29:12 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:77:"WPTavern: Why Company Culture Is So Important For Remote WordPress Developers";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=18689";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:198:"http://wptavern.com/why-company-culture-is-so-important-for-remote-wordpress-developers?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=why-company-culture-is-so-important-for-remote-wordpress-developers";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5364:"<div id="attachment_18752" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/RemoteWordPressWorkerFeaturedImage.png" rel="prettyphoto[18689]"><img class="size-large wp-image-18752" alt="Remote WordPress Worker Featured Image" src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/RemoteWordPressWorkerFeaturedImage-500x156.png" width="500" height="156" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">photo credit: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/icedsoul/2601694302/">icedsoul photography .:teymur madjderey</a> &#8211; <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/">cc</a></p></div>\n<p>I follow a handful of people who work with WordPress on a daily basis and I often see WordPress agencies publishing news about their recent hiring. I&#8217;ve noticed a lot of employees for WordPress agencies don&#8217;t seem to be sticking around with one company for very long. When I think of an employee staying at one company for a long time, I&#8217;m talking about three to five years although it&#8217;s easy to forget agencies like <a title="http://10up.com/" href="http://10up.com/">10up</a> have only been around for three years.</p>\n<p>Why does it seem like they are switching companies as if it&#8217;s no big deal? I sat back and pondered this question for a while and came up with the following conclusions.</p>\n<h3>Tons Of Employment Opportunities</h3>\n<p>Since WordPress powers 20% of the web, there are a multitude of employment opportunities.. If one company isn&#8217;t paying enough, chances are good that another company is. Of course, working for an agency isn&#8217;t required as sites like <a title="https://www.elance.com/" href="https://www.elance.com/">Elance</a> and <a title="https://www.odesk.com/" href="https://www.odesk.com/">oDesk</a> have proven there is high demand for individual freelancers who specialize in WordPress.</p>\n<h3>Insight From A 6 Year Old WordPress Company</h3>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/WebDevStudiosLogo2.png" rel="prettyphoto[18689]"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-18760" alt="WebDevStudios Logo " src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/WebDevStudiosLogo2.png" width="211" height="64" /></a>Founded in 2008, <a title="http://webdevstudios.com/" href="http://webdevstudios.com/">WebDevStudios</a> is one of the longest running WordPress development companies within the WordPress ecosystem. I asked co-owner Brad Williams what the attrition rate is for WebDevStudios. He told me very few employees have left the company since it was founded. He also told me they no longer hire contractors and every WebDevStudios employee is full-time.</p>\n<p>When asked if he&#8217;s seeing a lot of people apply for jobs at the company, he said &#8220;<em>We get quite a few applications when we post a job opening.</em>&#8221; Overall, Brad has seen a few remote employees bounce around, but doesn&#8217;t really consider it to be a widespread issue.</p>\n<h3>Switch Companies Without Ever Leaving Home</h3>\n<p>Remote WordPress employees have a distinct advantage over their physical workplace counterparts. They can switch companies without ever leaving home. Employees working in a physical location sometimes have to move to a different city for a promotion or for a new job. Remote workers can perform their jobs from anywhere in the world as long as they have an Internet connection. I think this is the single biggest reason remote workers can move between multiple companies within a one to two year timeframe.</p>\n<h3>Finding A Culture That Fits</h3>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/ithemeslogo2.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[18689]"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-10776" alt="iThemes logo 2" src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/ithemeslogo2.jpg" width="255" height="53" /></a>Thanks to remote workers not being tied to a physical location, it&#8217;s easier to find a company culture where they fit in. Automattic has done a great job of making sure every one of its employees blends in with its culture.</p>\n<p>For most companies, it&#8217;s not just about being an employee and getting work done. It&#8217;s about something larger than any one individual. When I&#8217;ve asked employees why they have switched between multiple companies within a year, the answer is usually the same. <em>It just wasn&#8217;t a good fit for me</em>.</p>\n<p>Glenn Ansley who works for <a title="http://ithemes.com/" href="http://ithemes.com/">iThemes</a> says his company does a great job keeping him connected to the company:</p>\n<blockquote><p>If you don&#8217;t feel connected to your team, the loyalty is probably closer to that of a freelance contractor than an employee. My guess is it&#8217;s harder to get full buy-in / ownership from a remote employee. iThemes does a great job keeping me connected.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>Not As Big Of A Problem As I Thought</h3>\n<p>After speaking with Cory Miller, Brad Williams, and Jake Goldman I&#8217;ve discovered the problem is not nearly as bad as I thought. Attrition rates for some of the largest, longest, running WordPress businesses are low and employees are sticking with them. However, for the reasons explained above, it&#8217;s easier to switch companies as a remote WordPress worker than a typical employee in a brick and mortar shop.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 12 Mar 2014 21:23:40 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:88:"WPTavern: WP Inject Makes It Easy to Add Free Creative Commons Images to WordPress Posts";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=18778";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:220:"http://wptavern.com/wp-inject-makes-it-easy-to-add-free-creative-commons-images-to-wordpress-posts?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wp-inject-makes-it-easy-to-add-free-creative-commons-images-to-wordpress-posts";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5010:"<p>Last week, Getty Images announced its new <a href="http://www.gettyimages.com/Creative/Frontdoor/embed" target="_blank">open-embed program</a>, which removes the watermark from many of the images in its library for non-commercial use. In exchange, Getty&#8217;s iframed images are plastered with its logo and force a row of large, unattractive social sharing buttons on each embed. Getty reserves the right to remove content from the embedded viewer at any time, which could potentially leave a trail of gaping black holes throughout your blog.</p>\n<p>Many <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/mar/07/photographers-getty-images" target="_blank">photographers</a> and <a href="http://www.poststat.us/getty-images-now-free-embed/" target="_blank">bloggers</a> are unimpressed with Getty&#8217;s implementation. Even with 35 million new &#8220;free&#8221; photos flooding the blogosphere, <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/" target="_blank">Creative Commons</a> images are likely to remain the preferred option, as they provide more creative freedom in styling the attribution and can be used in galleries, videos, design, etc.</p>\n<h3>WP Inject: A Homegrown Alternative to Getty&#8217;s Free Images</h3>\n<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-inject/" target="_blank">WP Inject</a> is a new free plugin that makes it easy to use CC-licensed images in your WordPress content with just a few clicks. In fact, you don&#8217;t even need to leave the admin. The plugin adds a search box to the post editor. The search is hooked up to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/creativecommons/" target="_blank">Flickr&#8217;s vast library of CC-licensed images</a>.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/wpinject.png" rel="prettyphoto[18778]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/wpinject.png" alt="wpinject" width="1395" height="1019" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18779" /></a></p>\n<p>WP Inject lets you compare multiple keyword search results to find the best match. Adding an image to your content is as easy as clicking on the size you want. The plugin automatically places it within your content and adds the correct attribution. It also saves the image to your server.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/wpinject2.png" rel="prettyphoto[18778]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/wpinject2.png" alt="wpinject2" width="1244" height="1110" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18782" /></a></p>\n<h3>Designed for Blogger Convenience</h3>\n<p>WP Inject, although somewhat unfortunately named, does not fail to impress in the features department. Every aspect of the plugin was designed for the blogger&#8217;s convenience, including the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Set the featured image for your post with a single click.</li>\n<li>Insert multiple images at once and create whole galleries.</li>\n<li>Sort by selected Creative Commons licenses.</li>\n<li>Choose between several image sizes easily.</li>\n<li>Modify the templates of WP Inject to change how images get displayed in your posts.</li>\n<li>Images are saved to your own server and added to the WordPress media library.</li>\n<li>Automatically populated ALT and title tags of the image for search engine optimization.</li>\n<li>Can use and insert your focus keyword set in WordPress SEO by Yoast for easier image search optimization.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thomas Hoefter, the plugin&#8217;s developer, is also the author of the <a href="http://wprobot.net/" target="_blank">WP Robot</a> plugin and founder of <a href="http://cmscommander.com/" target="_blank">CMS Commander</a>. WP Inject is a side project that grew out of his personal need for a solution to add featured images to new posts as quickly as possible. He said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Since I think finding good images for their posts is a problem lots of bloggers face, I have polished the plugin up last week and then released it. While there are a few alternatives out in the wild already (e.g. Photodropper), I found that most of them lacked features (at least some of which I needed) and/or are not actively updated anymore.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Hoefter plans to update WP Inject regularly and created a website with a <a href="http://wpinject.com/tutorial/" target="_blank">tutorial</a> on how to use the plugin. In the future, he intends to include more image sources in addition to Flickr. He also hopes to make it possible to inject other types of media, including videos, ads, products and news stories.</p>\n<p>After testing the plugin, I found that the in-post search is fast and convenient, since you don&#8217;t have to leave the WordPress admin to locate images for your content. It keeps you in the flow while writing and removes the hassle of having to open more browser tabs to search. WP Inject is a solid alternative to Getty&#8217;s free images. <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-inject/" target="_blank">Download</a> the plugin for free from WordPress.org.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 12 Mar 2014 18:34:43 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:51:"Alex King: Is WordPress the Right Tool for the Job?";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://alexking.org/?p=19550";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:57:"http://alexking.org/blog/2014/03/12/when-to-use-wordpress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2752:"<p>I recently got an email that asked:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Do you ever question whether WordPress is the correct CMS for something?</p>\n<p>I am a big WordPress fan too and I&#8217;ve solved some really cool content management challenges with it but there are times when I think, this site would probably be faster and more efficient if it were built using some MVC framework?</p>\n<p>[...]</p>\n<p>With small business sites, this isn&#8217;t really that big a deal but with some of the enterprise-level clients you work with I wonder whether it becomes an issue.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Rather than replying via email, I thought this might be a good topic for a blog post.</p>\n<p>First off, I should mention that when clients come to <a href="http://crowdfavorite.com">Crowd Favorite</a>, it is often because they have already made a technology choice to use WordPress and have found us because of our reputation in working with WordPress. That said, we believe in using the right tool for the job.</p>\n<p>Most often that tool is WordPress, but there are times when we suggest alternative solutions that are a better fit for their specific problem. We&#8217;ve used our Oxygen MVC platform for a number of client projects, sometimes in conjunction with a WordPress powered site.</p>\n<p>One of the great benefits to using WordPress vs. a custom solution is that scaling WordPress is generally a solved problem. There are lots of smart folks who have figured this out and shared their knowledge within the community. We are very comfortable deploying high traffic sites on WordPress.</p>\n<p>Scaling a custom application is often a journey of discovery. Sometimes this journey can be a bit rocky, and lonely. You will need to solve most of your problems on your own. This makes WordPress a safer choice when all other things are equal.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m on record saying I don&#8217;t believe WordPress is a good general application platform, but I think it&#8217;s wonderful for certain types of apps. Our developer journal, <a href="http://crowdfavorite.com/capsule/">Capsule</a> is a great example of this. We created a distributed journal app that can sync back to a central server/hub &#8211; all on WordPress. I&#8217;ve also created an HR logging system using WordPress. These have worked quite nicely.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, I believe in a pragmatic approach. The things that go into this decision include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>comparing site needs to what WordPress does out of the box</li>\n<li>consider known and projected future enhancements</li>\n<li>consider potential scaling concerns</li>\n<li>consider the importance of the community and lack of vendor lock-in to the client</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Happily, that means we choose WordPress much of the time.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 12 Mar 2014 17:08:18 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Alex";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:16;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:91:"WPTavern: How To Prevent WordPress From Participating In Pingback Denial of Service Attacks";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=18691";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:226:"http://wptavern.com/how-to-prevent-wordpress-from-participating-in-pingback-denial-of-service-attacks?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=how-to-prevent-wordpress-from-participating-in-pingback-denial-of-service-attacks";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5274:"<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/sucurilogo.png" rel="prettyphoto[18691]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/sucurilogo.png" alt="SucuriLogo" width="100" height="34" class="alignright size-full wp-image-5763" /></a>Security research firm Sucuri is reporting more than <a title="http://blog.sucuri.net/2014/03/more-than-162000-wordpress-sites-used-for-distributed-denial-of-service-attack.html" href="http://blog.sucuri.net/2014/03/more-than-162000-wordpress-sites-used-for-distributed-denial-of-service-attack.html">162,000 WordPress sites were used</a> in a distributed denial of service attack. Compromised machines or websites are generally used to facilitate these types of attacks but in this case, clean WordPress sites were used via XML-RPC.</p>\n<p><a title="http://codex.wordpress.org/XML-RPC_Support" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/XML-RPC_Support">XML-RPC</a> is used in WordPress as an API for third-party clients such as WordPress mobile apps, popular weblog clients like Windows Writer and popular plugins such as Jetpack. XML-RPC is used for pingbacks and trackbacks which are a good thing but can be heavily misused to start DDoS attacks.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Just in the course of a few hours, over 162,000 different and legitimate WordPress sites tried to attack his site. We would likely have detected a lot more sites, but we decided we had seen enough and blocked the requests at the edge firewall, mostly to avoid filling the logs with junk.</p>\n<p>One attacker can use thousands of popular and clean WordPress sites to perform their DDoS attack, while being hidden in the shadows, and that all happens with a simple ping back request to the XML-RPC file.</p></blockquote>\n<p>To see if your site was misused, Sucuri has a <a title="http://labs.sucuri.net/?is-my-wordpress-ddosing" href="http://labs.sucuri.net/?is-my-wordpress-ddosing">DDoS scanner available</a>. Enter your domain into the field provided and the scanner will try to locate it within their log files. If the domain doesn&#8217;t show up, you know the site wasn&#8217;t used to attack others.

The following code snippet will work correctly without any adverse effects. It disables pingbacks while allowing things like Jetpack and WordPress mobile apps to function normally. Add the code to your theme&#8217;s functions.php file.</p>\n<pre class="brush: php; title: ; notranslate">\nadd_filter( ''xmlrpc_methods'', ''remove_xmlrpc_pingback_ping'' );\nfunction remove_xmlrpc_pingback_ping( $methods ) {\n   unset( $methods[''pingback.ping''] );\n   return $methods;\n} ;\n</pre>\n<h3>Is It Time For Pingbacks and Trackbacks To Go?</h3>\n<p>WPTavern is no stranger to denial of service attacks due to pingbacks and trackbacks.

Shortly after the website came back online, I disabled both as I feared they might end up taking the site down again. A few years have gone by and I&#8217;ve re-enabled pingbacks and trackbacks with no ill effects.

It&#8217;s full of tiny improvements that improve the publishing experience, especially when it comes to editing content. You can now check it out first-hand, since 3.9 Beta 1 was released today. The official release is <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/version-3-9-project-schedule/" target="_blank">scheduled</a> to drop during the week of April 14th. Andrew Nacin <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2014/03/wordpress-3-9-beta-1/" target="_blank">announced</a> the beta with the customary haiku, which nicely sums up what you&#8217;ll find in 3.9:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Lots of improvements<br />\nLittle things go a long way<br />\nPlease test beta one</p></blockquote>\n<p>There are some exciting new features coming in 3.9, but a good portion of core development has also been dedicated to iterating on features introduced in previous releases. Nacin summarized a few of the major new items that need testing:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated to TinyMCE 4.0</li>\n<li>Widget customizer now rolled into core for live previews while managing widgets</li>\n<li>WP 3.8&#8242;s theme browsing experience extended to the theme installer</li>\n<li>Live preview for galleries in the editor &#8211; no more placeholder</li>\n<li>Drag-and-drop images directly onto the editor to upload</li>\n<li>Multiple improvements to image editing</li>\n<li>New audio/video playlists</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Nacin asked WordPress users what they&#8217;re most excited about for WordPress 3.9 and here are a few responses from the community:</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/nacin">@nacin</a> it''s small, but i love the improvements to editing images and no more new windows. sometimes it''s the little things.</p>\n<p>&mdash; David Bisset (@dimensionmedia) <a href="https://twitter.com/dimensionmedia/statuses/443468910806204416">March 11, 2014</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/nacin">@nacin</a> Bringing external js libraries up to their current release versions? <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23butimjustweird&src=hash">#butimjustweird</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; George Stephanis (@daljo628) <a href="https://twitter.com/daljo628/statuses/443468595360956417">March 11, 2014</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/nacin">@nacin</a> the ability to position cropped images.

Install the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/" target="_blank">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin and select &#8220;bleeding edge nightlies.&#8221; Alternatively, you can <a href="http://wordpress.org/wordpress-3.9-beta1.zip" target="_blank">simply download the zip file for the beta</a>.</p>\n<p>If you think you&#8217;ve found a bug, feel free to post it on the<a href="http://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta" target="_blank"> Alpha/Beta forum</a>. That is the easiest entry point for testing the beta and being part of making it better. If you&#8217;re able to <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/reporting-bugs/" target="_blank">submit a bug</a> on <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/reports/" target="_blank">WordPress core trac</a>, that&#8217;s even better.

This book is a much-needed resource for the BuddyPress community and could not have come at a better time.</p>\n<p>BuddyPress theming has evolved over the years but it has always had a steep learning curve. Part of the reason for this is that theming practices have been in flux as BuddyPress has improved. Contributors to the codex have worked hard to make sure the basics are in place but more in-depth tutorials tend to be scattered all over the web.</p>\n<p>Now that <a href="http://codex.buddypress.org/themes/theme-compatibility-1-7/a-quick-look-at-1-7-theme-compatibility/" target="_blank">theme compatibility</a> is in place to allow BP to work with any WordPress theme, <a href="http://logicalbinary.com/" target="_blank">Tammie Lister</a> decided that it was the right time to make a comprehensive guide. Lister is a long-time BuddyPress contributor who now works as a Theme Wrangler for Automattic. If you&#8217;re looking for an expert who will hold your feet to the fire when it comes to WordPress theming standards, Lister has you covered.</p>\n<h3>An Introduction to Basic WordPress Theming</h3>\n<p>One thing I appreciate about the book is that it does not assume the reader to already be an expert at WordPress theming. Lister takes a holistic approach and introduces the differences between social networking and building a community. While BuddyPress provides social networking features, building a community involves more than just activating the plugin and hoping people will use the site. Understanding the differences will help to shape the design process.</p>\n<p>She starts with the basics and provides a step-by-step guide for setting BuddyPress up on your server. She introduces theming by walking you through creating a child theme. You&#8217;ll learn all the basics, such as how to use your browser to inspect elements on the page in order to get the right selectors for making CSS changes.</p>\n<p>The book then moves into a basic introduction to WordPress theming before delving deeper into <a href="http://codex.buddypress.org/themes/theme-compatibility-1-7/template-hierarchy/" target="_blank">BuddyPress template hierarchy</a>. If you&#8217;re familiar with WordPress&#8217; <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Hierarchy" target="_blank">template hierarchy</a> then BuddyPress will come naturally, as it works the same way.</p>\n<h3>A Hands-On Guide to Creating BuddyPress Themes</h3>\n<p>With the theming basics under your belt, the next section puts you well on your way to building your own BuddyPress feature templates. This is necessary if you want to radically change the look of your community to customize it beyond the stock BuddyPress UI. Here&#8217;s where the hands-on fun begins. Lister walks the reader through building a sample responsive BuddyPress theme with unique elements, custom fonts, navigation menus, custom BuddyPress templates and more.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a developer who has just taken on a BuddyPress project for the first time and you&#8217;re new to BP theme development, this manual is a must-have. I highly recommend the process Lister uses for getting novice theme developers up to speed on the basics. You&#8217;ll go from installing BuddyPress to creating your very own theme in a short amount of time. Experienced BuddyPress developers will also appreciate the book as a reference for the proper way to customize themes. BuddyPress Theme Development is available from <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/BuddyPress-Theme-Development-Tammie-Lister-ebook/dp/B00G395ORG/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1382456253&sr=8-2&keywords=tammie+lister" target="_blank">Amazon</a>.

Be on the lookout for cleaner markup. Also try the new paste handling &#8212; if you paste in a block of text from Microsoft Word, for example, it will no longer come out terrible. (The &#8220;Paste from Word&#8221; button you probably never noticed has been removed.) It&#8217;s possible some plugins that added stuff to the visual editor (like a new toolbar button) no longer work, so we&#8217;d like to hear about them (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24067">#24067</a>). (And be sure to <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/">open a support thread</a> for the plugin author.)</li>\n<li>We&#8217;ve added <strong>widget management to live previews</strong> (the customizer). Please test editing, adding, and rearranging widgets! (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/27112">#27112</a>) We&#8217;ve also added the ability to upload, crop, and manage header images, without needing to leave the preview. (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/21785">#21785</a>)</li>\n<li>We brought 3.8&#8242;s beautiful new theme browsing experience to the <strong>theme installer</strong>. Check it out! (<a title="View ticket" href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/27055">#27055</a>)</li>\n<li><strong>Galleries</strong> now receive a live preview in the editor. Upload some photos and insert a gallery to see this in action. (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/26959">#26959</a>)</li>\n<li>You can now <strong>drag-and-drop</strong> images directly onto the editor to upload them. It can be a bit finicky, so try it and help us work out the kinks. (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/19845">#19845</a>)</li>\n<li>Some things got improved around <strong>editing images</strong>. It&#8217;s a lot easier to make changes to an image after you insert it into a post (<a class="closed" title="View ticket" href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24409">#24409</a>) and you no longer get kicked to a new window when you need to crop or rotate an image (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/21811">#21811</a>).</li>\n<li>New <strong>audio/video playlists</strong>. Upload a few audio or video files to test these.

Organized by Nathan Driver and a number of volunteers, the event was held on the campus of <a href="http://www.wright.edu/maps/facility/rike-hall" title="http://www.wright.edu/maps/facility/rike-hall">Wright State University within Rike Hall</a>. Other WordCamps I&#8217;ve attended on college campuses have gone well and this event was no exception.</p>\n<h3>WordCamp Dayton Started As A Meetup</h3>\n<p>When I asked Driver how WordCamp Dayton started, he told me it began with their local meetup. After visiting WordCamps throughout the state of Ohio, he discovered many of the attendees were from Southwest Ohio and wanted an event closer to home. He created a meetup around the Dayton area to gauge interest. &#8220;<em>After a couple of months of debating we went for it and had our first MeetUp in October 2012&#8243;.</em> After managing the meetup for a couple of months, Driver noticed interest grew along with memberships which is when he decided to begin the process of creating a WordCamp.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p>It begins. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23wcdayton&src=hash">#wcdayton</a> opening remarks <a href="http://t.co/zHSUxnC1HG">pic.twitter.com/zHSUxnC1HG</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Dustin Filippini (@dustyf) <a href="https://twitter.com/dustyf/statuses/442306845726633985">March 8, 2014</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>WordCamp Dayton was a two-day event with Friday featuring a beginners workshop. I was told around <strong>65</strong> people participated in the workshop where they were introduced to WordPress and learned about eCommerce as well as SEO. Saturday was dedicated to three different tracks of sessions covering publishers and users, power users, and developers.</p>\n<h3>New Event Filled With New Users</h3>\n<p>When Driver asked the audience how many of them were new to WordPress almost two-thirds of the room raised their hands. When he asked the audience if it was their first WordCamp, almost the same amount of hands were raised. Considering this was the first event of its kind in the area and so many people were new to WordPress, it&#8217;s impressive to see how many of them discovered and attended the event.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p>Deep dive into WordPress <a href="https://twitter.com/daytonwp">@daytonwp</a> with <a href="https://twitter.com/MarcBenzak">@MarcBenzak</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23wcdayton&src=hash">#wcdayton</a> <a href="http://t.co/7nQEN4Si0S">pic.twitter.com/7nQEN4Si0S</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Chris Celek (@ChrisCelek) <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisCelek/statuses/442317759977115649">March 8, 2014</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Cory Miller Delivers Inspirational Keynote</h3>\n<p>Cory Miller of <a title="http://ithemes.com/" href="http://ithemes.com/">iThemes.com</a> gave his <a title="http://www.slideshare.net/mobile/corymiller303/wordcamp-dayton-keynote" href="http://www.slideshare.net/mobile/corymiller303/wordcamp-dayton-keynote">keynote presentation</a> after lunch and it was filled with inspirational messages.

It takes drive, dedication, and a team of great volunteers. Driver told me one of the most challenging aspects of organizing the event was &#8220;<em>Finding the right individuals to have on the team and working with their schedule</em>&#8220;. While WordCamp is labeled a conference, it&#8217;s not the typical event people may be familiar with. As Driver told me, &#8220;<em>It&#8217;s not about sitting in a room and listening to a speaker and moving on to the next one. It&#8217;s about providing a community environment.</em>&#8221;</p>\n<p>I asked Driver what advice would he give to those organizing their first WordCamp:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Take your time. Contact everyone. Above all, have fun. As soon as you get the green light from <a href="http://central.wordcamp.org/" title="http://central.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp Central</a> go for it. Work through the tasks you think will be the most difficult first. Keep that momentum and keep going back to the reason why you wanted to have a WordCamp in your area. It&#8217;s not about you, it&#8217;s about the community. </p></blockquote>\n<h3>First Time Event Is A Flying Success</h3>\n<p>First time WordCamps usually have hiccups. While we did have a schedule change and had to switch rooms once to account for the number of people showing up to certain sessions, the rest of the event was perfect. The catered food was delicious, there was plenty of time for networking, and the location was just right. I commend and thank Nathan Driver along with all of his volunteers for helping make the first WordCamp Dayton such a success. I hope it becomes an annual tradition.</p>\n<p>Last but not least, WordCamp Dayton reminded me that although WordPress is software, it&#8217;s the people behind it that make all the difference.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23wcdayton&src=hash">#wcdayton</a> WordCamps are reminders that while WordPress is software, it’s the people surrounding it that make all the difference.</p>\n<p>&mdash; Jeff (@jeffr0) <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffr0/statuses/442541639228071937">March 9, 2014</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 11 Mar 2014 01:30:51 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:72:"WordPress.tv: Amaury Balmer: Industrialiser son ou ses projets WordPress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wordpress.tv/?p=31977";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:89:"http://wordpress.tv/2014/03/10/amaury-balmer-industrialiser-son-ou-ses-projets-wordpress/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:673:"<div id="v-RNF5R6Jq-1" class="video-player">\n</div><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/wptv.wordpress.com/31977/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/wptv.wordpress.com/31977/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=wordpress.tv&blog=5089392&post=31977&subd=wptv&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1" /><div><a href="http://wordpress.tv/2014/03/10/amaury-balmer-industrialiser-son-ou-ses-projets-wordpress/"><img alt="Amaury Balmer WordCamp Paris 2014. mp4" src="http://videos.videopress.com/RNF5R6Jq/video-0a5ff0065f_std.original.jpg" width="160" height="120" /></a></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 10 Mar 2014 22:30:53 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"WordPress.tv";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:73:"WPTavern: Dazzling: A Free Flat Design WordPress Theme Based on Bootstrap";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=18664";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:188:"http://wptavern.com/dazzling-a-free-flat-design-wordpress-theme-based-on-bootstrap?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=dazzling-a-free-flat-design-wordpress-theme-based-on-bootstrap";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2213:"<p>Dazzling is a new free theme that landed in the <a href="http://wordpress.org/themes/" target="_blank">WordPress Themes Directory</a> last week.

The best way to stay in touch with your user base is to subscribe to the support forums, since that&#8217;s the first place people generally go when looking for answers. Subscription options vary, depending on if it&#8217;s a plugin vs. a theme, so we&#8217;ll cover ways to keep yourself informed for each.</p>\n<h3>How to Subscribe to Plugin Support Forums</h3>\n<p>Plugins are fairly easy, because there&#8217;s a ready-made option for plugin authors who prefer email notifications for support forums. Scroll to the bottom of the support forum and you will find the option to subscribe via email.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/plugin-support.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[18617]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/plugin-support.jpg" alt="plugin-support" width="774" height="175" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18622" /></a></p>\n<p>Of course, if you feel like your inbox is a dead end, you might make use of the RSS feed. Each plugin on WordPress.org has its own unique RSS feed. Plugin authors who have multiple works can subscribe to all of their plugins at once using this feed:</p>\n<pre>http://wordpress.org/support/rss/view/plugin-committer/yourusername</pre>\n<p>Given that RSS is the only option for subscribing to theme support forums, I&#8217;ll describe a few ways to utilize RSS below.</p>\n<h3>How to Subscribe to Theme Support Forums</h3>\n<p>Currently there is no option for subscribing to WordPress.org theme support forums by email. I checked with Samuel Wood (aka &#8220;Otto&#8221;), who works on the site, to find out if it&#8217;s something they will add. He said that it&#8217;s on the road map for the future.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, RSS is your only option, but it actually opens up many possibilities. RSS allows you to funnel data to yourself in different ways. If you want updates by email, you can easily sign up using a service like <a href="https://ifttt.com/" target="_blank">IFTTT</a> or <a href="http://wptavern.com/ http://blogtrottr.com/">Blogtrottr</a>.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/ifttt.png" rel="prettyphoto[18617]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/ifttt.png" alt="ifttt" width="775" height="296" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18624" /></a></p>\n<p>If you want to be super militant about responding to support requests, you could set up an <a href="https://ifttt.com/" target="_blank">IFTTT</a> to route the RSS feed to SMS.</p>\n<p>Another option is set up an IFTTT recipe to channel RSS updates to an email that is specific for adding tasks to Evernote, Wunderlist, Asana, Remember The Milk or your favorite to-do app. Since both plugins and themes have RSS feeds, there many ways to put those feeds to work for you. Bypassing your inbox entirely may help you to be more organized and efficient in providing support for your plugins and themes.</p>\n<h3>Why It&#8217;s Important to Stay on Top of Support</h3>\n<div id="attachment_18634" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/origin_4900913730.png" rel="prettyphoto[18617]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/origin_4900913730-300x300.png" alt="photo credit: Open Kitchen España - cc" width="300" height="300" class="size-medium wp-image-18634" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">photo credit: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/open-kitchen/4900913730/">Open Kitchen España</a> &#8211; <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">cc</a></p></div>\n<p>Even if you don&#8217;t have the time to commit to jump in on the forums as often as you&#8217;d like, notices routed to your inbox or to-do app will log those issues in the back of your mind. You&#8217;ll become more aware of areas where you might be able to improve plugin or theme documentation. The next time you get a rainy Saturday, you&#8217;ll already be poised to tackle potential issues that need updating in your themes and plugins.</p>\n<p>Chances are that the reason you put your extension on WordPress.org was so that other people can use what you made. Staying on top of support will ultimately serve to make your users happier. This can potentially increase your ratings, generate better reviews and boost confidence for new users who are checking out your extension for the first time.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 10 Mar 2014 17:42:23 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:78:"WPTavern: A Look Behind PropsPress: A Site Dedicated to WordPress Contributors";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=18345";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:198:"http://wptavern.com/a-look-behind-propspress-a-site-dedicated-to-wordpress-contributors?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=a-look-behind-propspress-a-site-dedicated-to-wordpress-contributors";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6919:"<div id="attachment_18610" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/thanks.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[18345]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/thanks.jpg" alt="photo credit: marc falardeau - cc" width="905" height="412" class="size-full wp-image-18610" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">photo credit: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/49889874@N05/5278676260/">marc falardeau</a> &#8211; <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">cc</a></p></div>\n<p><a href="http://propspress.com/" target="_blank">PropsPress</a> is an inspirational WordPress site that publishes posts, recognizing code contributed to the WordPress core. The site uses <a href="https://ifttt.com/" target="_blank">IFTTT</a> to monitor the changesets from the wordpress.org trac system and re-publishes the commit messages with &#8220;props&#8221; to recognize the folks who worked on the code.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/props.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[18345]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/props.jpg" alt="props" width="492" height="146" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18543" /></a></p>\n<p>WordPress developer <a href="https://twitter.com/k_payne" target="_blank">Kurt Payne</a> created the site with a desire to illustrate how WordPress is built through the combined efforts of many people. &#8220;PropsPress was a fun pet project I started a long time ago when I first got involved in WordPress contributions,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I thought it would be fun to have a central place to have a call-out whenever a piece of code was contributed.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Why PropsPress?</h3>\n<p>When Payne first set up PropsPress, he wanted to highlight contributions in order to inspire more people to get involved in core contributions:</p>\n<blockquote><p>When I first started contributing (July 2011 or so), the core group felt pretty small and it was difficult to get people contributing.  I perceived a problem of too much work (too many trac tickets, too many things needed testing), and too little knowledge (too few core members had the right knowledge of how to use trac / WordPress).</p></blockquote>\n<p>Since that time, however, WordPress has added <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/12/31/commit-announcements-for-3-9/" target="_blank">several new committers</a> and has made great strides in making contribution more accessible vai the <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/" target="_blank">Core Contributors Handbook</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;Overall, WordPress is a much friendlier place for contributors,&#8221;</strong> Payne said, which he attributed to the recent <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-core-trac-gets-a-design-refresh-new-features-and-enhancements" target="_blank">trac re-organization and refresh</a>, as well as the addition of new group leads to help facilitate communication and representation.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, PropsPress has been quietly <a href="https://twitter.com/propspress" target="_blank">tweeting</a> out props and publishing commit messages. &#8220;I was hoping to augment what WordPress was already doing with &#8216;recent rockstars&#8217; but on a more regular basis,&#8221; Payne said. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know where it would go, so I kinda let it bake.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>A New Direction for PropsPress</h3>\n<p>Payne is unsure as to whether PropsPress actually moved the needle to inspire more contributions to WordPress but he&#8217;s looking to use the website as a way to give back to the community. He&#8217;s got a few ideas to add stats tracking for all forms of WordPress contribution:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Codex contributions, support in irc / forums, ticket contributions (gardening, testing), translations, monetary donations, etc. This is all in addition to the code contributions.  I think these would be fantastic to track.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Ideally, Payne would like to be able to show a range of individual stats, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Number of submitted patches</li>\n<li>Number of accepted contributions</li>\n<li>Number of ticket touches</li>\n<li>Pie chart of JS / PHP / HTML</li>\n<li>Pie chart of unit tests vs. core code</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Payne says the idea is more for recognition and encouragement than for competition. He has reservations about adding too much gamification. &#8220;<span class="pullquote alignleft">It can be dangerous to gamify it too much because then it can become less about the altruism and more about the game.</span>&#8221;</p>\n<p>He hopes to backfill PropsPress to put each post in a tag for the users who are props&#8217;d so that the props would be queryable using WordPress taxonomies. Another interesting addition that he&#8217;d like to bring is a per-release total of &#8220;core committer code&#8221; vs &#8220;props code&#8221; in a stacked graph. &#8220;The hope is that the props code, in aggregate, is trending up!&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>One fun idea he has is to see WordPress identify &#8220;commit-anniversaries&#8221; and celebrate them, too.</p>\n<blockquote><p>This is easy to automate and is already celebrated on Twitter manually. Imagine if you woke up to &#8217;1 year ago, your code was pulled into WordPress 3.6. Thank you!&#8217; with a link to the ticket. That&#8217;s something you can retweet and that&#8217;s something that people can get excited about.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Some of these ideas have been included in past WordPress <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/2012/12/28/contributor-stats/" target="_blank">community discussions</a> on WordPress stats, though it may not be possible to easily access this information at this point in time.</p>\n<p>Payne said that he would love to work on this project again but he needs help. &#8220;As you can tell, I have big vision and little time. Some suggestions from the leaders in the community would help set the direction.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>The Value of Knowing Where Contributions Come From</h3>\n<p>Payne believes that changes to PropsPress can help provide more information on where WordPress contributions come from, with the ultimate goal of improving the contribution experience. He poses a few examples:</p>\n<blockquote><p>What if WP knew that 90% of its code came from 10 people, and the other 10% came from 100 people &#8230; that&#8217;s good to know.  Or what if I told you that 80% of contributors were one-time contributors only?  That&#8217;s a totally made up number, but that type of metric is actionable. You can go find those one time contributors and do deep dives into their contribution experiences to find out why they aren&#8217;t contributing again.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Payne is open to ideas and suggestions from the community to improve <a href="http://propspress.com/" target="_blank">PropsPress</a>. What do you think about the concept of the site? Does it serve a valuable purpose?</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 07 Mar 2014 23:50:12 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:54:"WPTavern: Visualize WordPress Project Stats With Ohloh";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=18560";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:152:"http://wptavern.com/visualize-wordpress-project-stats-with-ohloh?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=visualize-wordpress-project-stats-with-ohloh";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6489:"<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/wordpress-stats.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[18560]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/wordpress-stats.jpg" alt="wordpress-stats" width="796" height="369" class="alignright size-full wp-image-18589" /></a></p>\n<p><a href="http://www.ohloh.net/" target="_blank">Ohloh</a> is an excellent resource for tracking open source projects and their contributions. The site allows you to search 10 billion lines of code and provides some fascinating data sets for OS projects, including <a href="http://www.ohloh.net/p/wordpress" target="_blank">WordPress</a> and many of its popular plugins.</p>\n<p>Ohloh&#8217;s analysis of &#8220;WordPress in a Nutshell&#8221; is based on the stats it was able to mine from the code and some in-house estimates. It provides an interesting perspective on the project:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>WordPress has had <a href="http://www.ohloh.net/p/wordpress/commits/summary" target="_blank">25,085 commits</a> made by <a href="http://www.ohloh.net/p/wordpress/contributors/summary" target="_blank">52 contributors</a> representing <a href="http://www.ohloh.net/p/wordpress/analyses/latest/languages_summary" target="_blank">248,090 lines of code</a></li>\n<li>WordPress is mostly written in PHP with an average number of source code comments (as compared to other PHP projects in Ohloh)</li>\n<li>WordPress has a well established, mature codebase, maintained by a large development team with <a href="http://www.ohloh.net/p/wordpress/factoids#FactoidActivityStable" target="_blank">stable Y-O-Y commits</a></li>\n<li>WordPress took an estimated <a href="http://www.ohloh.net/p/wordpress/estimated_cost" target="_blank">64 years of effort</a> (COCOMO model) starting with its <a href="http://www.ohloh.net/p/wordpress/commits?sort=oldest" target="_blank">first commit</a> in April, 2003, ending with its most recent commit about 4 hours ago</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition to the historical data provided about commits to the project, the assessment of the trends in recent activity is quite valuable to those working within the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n<h3>Communicating &#8220;Free, Yet Priceless&#8221; Is Not Easy</h3>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve built a business around providing WordPress development services, the insight provided here can help you articulate your confidence in the stability of the project for clients who are new to OS software. The notion of using software that is free to download may be off-putting to business owners who are used to judging value by dollars and time invested.</p>\n<p>Ohlo&#8217;s <a href="http://www.ohloh.net/p/wordpress/estimated_cost" target="_blank">estimated cost</a> of WordPress is $3,488,557 with 63 person-years of effort, using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COCOMO" target="_blank">Constructive Cost Model (COCOMO)</a>. While software cost estimation isn&#8217;t an exact science, especially for distributed open-source projects, a basic understanding of the COCOMO calculations provides an interesting perspective on WordPress&#8217; value. It also reveals the power of like-minded contributors working together toward a common goal.</p>\n<p>When you take into account the combined personnel attributes required to engineer and maintain a project of this size, there are few corporate entities that would have the budget to produce a project like WordPress in-house for their own development needs. That&#8217;s the beauty of open source software. Developers are happy to contribute to projects they believe in, and you can bank on people believing in the philosophy behind WordPress.</p>\n<h3>Visualize WordPress Lines of Code By Language</h3>\n<p>The <a href="http://www.ohloh.net/p/wordpress/analyses/latest/languages_summary" target="_blank">languages summary</a> of the code base is of particular interest during a time when the WordPress community has been enthusiastically embracing <a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-think-tank-panel-will-discuss-the-future-of-wordpress-on-feb-25th" target="_blank">dialogues</a> about its future. Ohloh offers a visual representation of WordPress lines of code by language:</p>\n<div id="attachment_18577" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/wordpress-code-by-language.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[18560]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/wordpress-code-by-language.jpg" alt="WordPress lines of code by Language" width="954" height="688" class="size-full wp-image-18577" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">WordPress lines of code by Language</p></div>\n<p>It&#8217;s interesting to note that CSS and Javascript seem to parallel each other in terms of moderate growth over the years. PHP is still the fastest growing language in the code base, although WordPress co-founder Matt Mullenweg predicts that Javascript will someday make up the better part of its code. When speaking at <a href="http://2013.europe.wordcamp.org/" target="_blank">WordCamp Europe 2013</a>, Mullenweg&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/TacoVerdo/status/386810803640209408" target="_blank">advice</a> to attendees was: &#8220;If you&#8217;re a developer today, learn as much JavaScript as possible.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Ohloh&#8217;s graphs make it easy to visualize composite languages used in WordPress code and lets you toggle by year in order to further explore the data and follow the resulting trends.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/commits-per-month.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[18560]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/commits-per-month-300x152.jpg" alt="commits-per-month" width="300" height="152" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-18587" /></a>Even with Ohloh&#8217;s limited access to the project&#8217;s public data, it&#8217;s fascinating to see how it has been able to provide visuals for stats such as <a href="http://www.ohloh.net/p/wordpress/commits/summary" target="_blank">commits per month</a> and <a href="http://www.ohloh.net/p/wordpress/contributors/summary" target="_blank">contributors per month</a>.</p>\n<p>It would be awesome if some day WordPress.org could display more stats related to its code and contributions, which would undoubtedly provide some more meaningful data on other aspects of the project as a whole.

I hold comments in high regard because they often provide more insight into the topic being discussed. Comments are a validation someone&#8217;s reading my content and I look forward to reading every one of them.</p>\n<p>WordPress comments haven&#8217;t changed much in the past few years. Brian Krogsgard over at Postat.us has <a title="http://www.poststat.us/wordpress-comments/" href="http://www.poststat.us/wordpress-comments/">published a list of ideas he has</a> to improve the way comments function in WordPress. His ideas are solid and I agree with them, especially the idea to remove what one of his clients considered to be <em>computer code</em> from the bottom of the comment form.</p>\n<div id="attachment_18508" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/CommentComputerCode.png" rel="prettyphoto[18466]"><img class="size-large wp-image-18508" alt="So Called Computer Code" src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/CommentComputerCode-500x131.png" width="500" height="131" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">So Called Computer Code</p></div>\n<p>This code should be removed as suggested by Brian but I&#8217;d extend the idea to replace the text with WYSIWYG buttons people are familiar with to style text. They&#8217;re called Quicktags and WordPress supports them out of the box via the <a title="http://codex.wordpress.org/Quicktags_API" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Quicktags_API">Quicktags API</a>. Quicktags provide the same type of buttons you&#8217;d see when writing a post in the Text editor of WordPress. Bonus points to theme authors who style the tags to match the rest of the theme.</p>\n<h3>Comments Of The Third Party Kind</h3>\n<p>The first thing I do after I read an article is read the comments if they&#8217;re available. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s becoming increasingly rare to see popular sites powered by WordPress using the native comment system. Most of the comment forms I see look like this.</p>\n<div id="attachment_18509" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/CommentsByDisqus.png" rel="prettyphoto[18466]"><img class="size-large wp-image-18509" alt="Comments by disqus" src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/CommentsByDisqus-500x420.png" width="500" height="420" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Comments by disqus</p></div>\n<p>Personally, I don&#8217;t like seeing two columns of related content underneath the current conversation. I find it confusing to figure out where a conversation ends. The bottom line is more and more sites are turning to third party comment systems because of the features they have out of the box.</p>\n<h3>Automattic Tried With IntenseDebate</h3>\n<div id="attachment_18513" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IntenseDebateCommentForm.png" rel="prettyphoto[18466]"><img class="size-large wp-image-18513" alt="IntenseDebate Comment Form" src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IntenseDebateCommentForm-500x343.png" width="500" height="343" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">IntenseDebate Comment Form</p></div>\n<p><a title="http://blog.intensedebate.com/2008/09/23/automattic-acquires-intensedebate/" href="http://blog.intensedebate.com/2008/09/23/automattic-acquires-intensedebate/">Acquired in September of 2008</a> by Automattic, <a title="http://www.intensedebate.com/" href="http://www.intensedebate.com/">IntenseDebate</a> was one of many commenting services launched that year including <a href="http://disqus.com/">Disqus</a>, <a href="http://sezwho.com/">SezWho</a>, and <a href="http://js-kit.com/">JS-Kit</a>. IntenseDebate had some cool features for comments at the time such as threaded comments and reply by email. Fast forward six years later and IntenseDebate is now on hiatus. This was confirmed by Matt Mullenweg when we interviewed him on <a title="http://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-130-catching-up-with-matt-mullenweg" href="http://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-130-catching-up-with-matt-mullenweg">episode 130 of WordPress Weekly</a>.</p>\n<p>When I asked him about the status of IntenseDebate, he replied &#8220;<em>IntenseDebate is currently on hold. It&#8217;s not actively being worked on inside Automattic. But there has been a lot of work on the Jetpack comment features such as subscriptions and interactions with social networks.</em>&#8221;</p>\n<p>He also mentioned WordPress hasn&#8217;t done a lot of things to improve areas that are user facing such as comments. The last major improvement to comments was the addition of threaded comments in <a title="http://wordpress.org/news/2008/12/coltrane/" href="http://wordpress.org/news/2008/12/coltrane/">WordPress 2.7 &#8216;Coltrane&#8217;</a>. He explained, &#8220;<em>It&#8217;s very difficult to iterate comments as it&#8217;s hard to get those changes to be compatible with every WordPress theme in the world.</em>&#8221; He mentioned the possible use of API&#8217;s and ended his answer with &#8220;<em>the most interesting things happening with comments are services and Automattic&#8217;s work with Jetpack Comments.</em>&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Jetpack Powered Comments</h3>\n<p>I think it’s quite telling that WordPress.com doesn’t use IntenseDebate. Instead, it uses a custom comment system that supports using credentials from four major social media services. <strong>WordPress.com, Twitter, Facebook, and Google+</strong>. If you use Jetpack, you can use the same comment system by activating the <a title="http://jetpack.me/support/comments/" href="http://jetpack.me/support/comments/">Jetpack Comments</a> module.</p>\n<div id="attachment_18512" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/JetpackCommentForm.png" rel="prettyphoto[18466]"><img class="size-large wp-image-18512" alt="Jetpack Comment Form" src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/JetpackCommentForm-500x289.png" width="500" height="289" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Jetpack Comment Form</p></div>\n<p>The biggest problem I have with Jetpack Comments is it&#8217;s not easily extendable using various comment plugins. Or, not many plugins are compatible with Jetpack Comments. At least with IntenseDebate, there is a <a title="http://intensedebate.com/plugins" href="http://intensedebate.com/plugins">library of plugins</a> to add features on top of what the service already offers. Since Jetpack Comments is tied to a plugin, it&#8217;s not platform agnostic like IntenseDebate.</p>\n<h3>The Future Of Comments In WordPress Is Unclear</h3>\n<p>Between Jetpack comments and IntenseDebate, it&#8217;s unclear what the future holds for the native comment system in WordPress. There have been multiple discussions around the topic of removing comments from core and putting them into a plugin but the idea hasn&#8217;t gained traction.</p>\n<p>My hope is that native WordPress comments will continue to improve to the point where using a third party is counter-productive. I want to see WordPress make it as easy as possible to contribute to conversations on the web. When Matt Mullenweg <a title="http://ma.tt/2008/09/intense-debate-goes-automattic/" href="http://ma.tt/2008/09/intense-debate-goes-automattic/">published the announcement</a> of acquiring IntenseDebate on his blog in 2008, he said the following:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Long-term, I think that comments are the most crucial interaction point for blogs, and an area that deserves a lot of investment and innovation.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I hope he still feels that way about comments and will strive to improve that area of WordPress sooner, rather than later.</p>\n<h3>Further Reading</h3>\n<p>I encourage everyone to read <a title="http://wptavern.com/dear-automattic-you-are-losing-the-debate" href="http://wptavern.com/dear-automattic-you-are-losing-the-debate">this blog post</a> from July 2, 2013 where Erlend Sogge Heggen wrote a post on how Automattic is losing the debate. It&#8217;s a detailed article that talks about IntenseDebate, Automattic, and commenting in WordPress in general. Also worth reading is the discussion that followed in the comments.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 07 Mar 2014 14:00:20 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:31;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:84:"WPTavern: BuddyPress and bbPress Websites Are Now Open Source: Contributions Welcome";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=18506";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:210:"http://wptavern.com/buddypress-and-bbpress-websites-are-now-open-source-contributions-welcome?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=buddypress-and-bbpress-websites-are-now-open-source-contributions-welcome";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2188:"<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/buddypress-wallpapers.png" rel="prettyphoto[18506]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/buddypress-wallpapers-300x225.png" alt="buddypress-wallpapers" width="300" height="225" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-16152" /></a>The code that powers the <a href="http://buddypress.org/" target="_blank">BuddyPress.org</a> and <a href="http://bbpress.org/" target="_blank">bbPress.org</a> websites is now open source.

In Jacoby&#8217;s <a href="http://bbpress.org/blog/2014/03/open-sourcing-bbpress-org/" target="_blank">announcement</a> on bbPress.org, he explained that the bbPress website is actually part of BuddyPress.org&#8217;s WordPress installation and they share some of the same code.</p>\n<p>Open sourcing the code for these sites makes it possible for the community to take a more active role in contributing to improvements. Jacoby hopes that contributors will be enthusiastic about working together to bring new design, features, and direction to the websites:</p>\n<blockquote><p>You’re now able to checkout, review, and patch the code that makes BuddyPress.org happily hum along. This is exciting for a few obvious reasons (like security, and really putting our open source philosophies where our code is) but the one I’m most excited about is it takes enhancements to the site out of our hands, and potentially puts them into yours.</p></blockquote>\n<p>His post was essentially an open invitation to the bbPress and BuddyPress communities.

Two weeks ago, Daniel Bachhuber opened a <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/27192" target="_blank">ticket</a> proposing that WordPress instruct users to change their passwords when sending new account emails.</p>\n<p>When a user is added to a multisite network and has activated his account, WordPress sends out an email that includes the new password:</p>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/multisite-new-user.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[18488]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/multisite-new-user.jpg" alt="multisite-new-user" width="645" height="441" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18491" /></a></p>\n<p>Several text changes were proposed for the email to urge users to change their passwords after logging in.  After a brief discussion during yesterday&#8217;s core development meeting, Andrew Nacin moved the issue to the <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/components/users/login-registration/" target="_blank">Login and Registration</a> component.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to skip this entirely for 3.9,&#8221; Nacin said. He highlighted the reasons why the incremental improvements in the proposed patches don&#8217;t solve the issue, given that they:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Only apply to multisite (emails are sent in plain text for new user registrations in single-site too)</li>\n<li>Only apply for the fallback email template (these are editable in multisite)\n<li>Don&#8217;t do anything in the dashboard to nag the user</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Nacin proposed that the core team tackle the issue for WordPress 4.0 in a way that will clearly improve the user experience. He also suggested that this issue might be combined with work on another <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24633" target="_blank">enhancement</a> that would allow admins to generate and send new passwords for users.</p>\n<p>This is a much larger task than simply changing the email text. &#8220;It&#8217;ll probably require a group of contributors to storyboard out exactly how all of this should work in an ideal situation, and then we can go about coding it,&#8221; Nacin said in response to the ticket. Aaron Jorbin <a href="http://irclogs.wordpress.org/chanlog.php?channel=wordpress-dev&day=2014-03-05&sort=asc#m805112" target="_blank">proposed</a> putting together a &#8220;Password Process&#8221; group to &#8220;identify some more concrete changes that we can make in 4.0 (including eliminating sending passwords via email).&#8221;</p>\n<p>If the team can find some momentum, this issue will be getting attention in WordPress 4.0.

As of WordPress 3.8, theme authors have the ability to <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/26352" target="_blank">customize defaults</a> when adding custom background support. For example, you can set a default for any of the following <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_background.asp" target="_blank">CSS background properties</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>background-color</li>\n<li>background-image</li>\n<li>background-repeat</li>\n<li>background-attachment</li>\n<li>background-position</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Oftentimes users want their sites to look similar to the demo, but they may be unaware of how to adjust the background properties to achieve that. It&#8217;s nice to have some defaults in place so that the theme looks similar to the demo right out of the box, without any adjustments.</p>\n<p>Depending on the background image that you select, it can be advantageous to set its defaults to the most sensible display for that image. For example, if your default background is an image that&#8217;s meant to tile, you want it displayed like that after the user activates the theme.</p>\n<p>Adding custom background support to the customizer is done through your theme&#8217;s <em>functions.php</em> file:</p>\n<pre class="brush: php; light: true; title: ; notranslate">add_theme_support( ''custom-background'' );</pre>\n<p>From here you can further customize the background properties by adding default arguments. Usually themes add custom background support to a setup function with other customizer options. Here&#8217;s a quick example of setting a default background to no-repeat, centered position with fixed attachment.</p>\n<pre class="brush: php; title: ; notranslate">function yourtheme_setup() {\n	add_theme_support(\n		''custom-background'',\n		array(\n			''default-color'' =&gt; ''2d2d2d'',\n			''default-image'' =&gt; get_template_directory_uri() . ''/images/background.jpg'',\n			''default-repeat''     =&gt; ''no-repeat'',\n			''default-position-x'' =&gt; ''center'',\n			''default-attachment'' =&gt; ''fixed'',\n\n		)\n	);\n}\nadd_action( ''after_setup_theme'', ''yourtheme_setup'' );\n</pre>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what that looks like in the customizer by default after the user installs the new theme:</p>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/background-customizer.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[18114]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/background-customizer.jpg" alt="background-customizer" width="874" height="584" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18475" /></a></p>\n<p>Of course, the user can still adjust these properties through the customizer to suit their own custom background images. The defaults simply ensure that the packaged background image looks nice when the theme is activated for the first time.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 06 Mar 2014 21:27:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:36;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"bbPress: Open Sourcing bbPress.org";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://bbpress.org/?p=143352";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:58:"http://bbpress.org/blog/2014/03/open-sourcing-bbpress-org/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1054:"<p>Pssst&#8230; want to know a secret?

As a quick fix, I simply replaced all of those calls with WordPress&#8217; <code>esc_sql()</code> function. Voila, problem fixed.</p>\n<p>Curious, I took a peek into <code>wp-db.php</code>, and found this block of code:</p>\n<pre><code>\n/* Use ext/mysqli if it exists and:\n *  - USE_EXT_MYSQL is defined as false, or\n *  - We are a development version of WordPress, or\n *  - We are running PHP 5.5 or greater, or\n *  - ext/mysql is not loaded.\n */\nif ( function_exists( ''mysqli_connect'' ) ) {\n        if ( defined( ''USE_EXT_MYSQL'' ) ) {\n                $this-&gt;use_mysqli = ! USE_EXT_MYSQL;\n        } elseif ( version_compare( phpversion(), ''5.5'', ''&gt;='' ) || ! function_exists( ''mysql_connect'' ) ) {\n                $this-&gt;use_mysqli = true;\n        } elseif ( false !== strpos( $GLOBALS[''wp_version''], ''-'' ) ) {\n                $this-&gt;use_mysqli = true;\n        }\n}</code></pre>\n<p>Note the bit about using a development version of WordPress. In my case, I&#8217;m running out of svn trunk, and my server has the <code>mysqli</code> extension installed, so <code>wpdb</code> chose to use it. That&#8217;s fine.</p>\n<p>But this exposes the fact that some plugins use functions like <code>mysql_real_escape_string()</code> &#8220;in the raw&#8221;, so to speak, which depends on using PHP&#8217;s <code>mysql</code> extension, and not <code>mysqli</code>. WordPress provides convenience functions like <code><a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/esc_sql">esc_sql</a>()</code> and <code><a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/wpdb#Protect_Queries_Against_SQL_Injection_Attacks">$wpdb-&gt;prepare()</a></code> to help abstract details like this away and protect developers against environmental differences between servers.</p>\n<p>Hopefully this will save somebody else out there some debugging time.</p>\n<p>Original Article: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2014/03/06/mysql-vs-mysqli-wordpress/">mysql vs mysqli in WordPress</a>\n<a rel="nofollow" href="http://dougal.gunters.org">Dougal Campbell&#039;s geek ramblings - WordPress, web development, and world domination.</a></p><div class="yarpp-related-rss yarpp-related-none">\n<img src="http://yarpp.org/pixels/5db43ee24c4f1e1d0e45d08cc91b0130" alt="YARPP" />\n</div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 06 Mar 2014 17:30:19 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"Dougal Campbell";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:39;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:51:"WPTavern: Official Gravatar Mobile App In The Works";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=18451";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:146:"http://wptavern.com/official-gravatar-mobile-app-in-the-works?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=official-gravatar-mobile-app-in-the-works";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1612:"<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/GravatarLogo.png" rel="prettyphoto[18451]"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-18453" alt="Gravatar Logo 2" src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/GravatarLogo.png" width="239" height="63" /></a>Toni Schneider, <a title="http://ma.tt/2014/01/toni-automattic-ceo/" href="http://ma.tt/2014/01/toni-automattic-ceo/">who recently switched positions</a> with Matt Mullenweg inside Automattic has <a title="http://blog.gravatar.com/2014/03/05/a-question-for-gravatar-users/" href="http://blog.gravatar.com/2014/03/05/a-question-for-gravatar-users/">asked on the Gravatar blog</a>, <em>Which platform should a Gravatar app be released for first?</em>.

The goal of the service is to eliminate the stress and hassles of selling WordPress products allowing the developer to concentrate on the product itself. Some of the most difficult aspects of running a business such as licensing, memberships, refunds, secure download links, and refunds are handled through SellWP.</p>\n<div id="attachment_18428" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/SellWPFeatures.png" rel="prettyphoto[18395]"><img class="size-large wp-image-18428" alt="Just A Few Of The Features SellWP Offers Sellers" src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/SellWPFeatures-500x273.png" width="500" height="273" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Just A Few Of The Features SellWP Offers Sellers</p></div>\n<h3>SellWP Is Not A Marketplace, But A Managed Solution For Selling Products</h3>\n<p>While I initially thought it would be a marketplace to sell themes and plugins, Turner informed me it&#8217;s not a marketplace at all. &#8220;<em>The user markets the theme or plugin on their site and when the customer clicks buy now, it takes them to the hosted solution. The customer and license is then managed through SellWP.</em>&#8221; While marketplaces can take anywhere between 20-50% of a sale, SellWP only takes <strong>1.9% + 15¢</strong> per charge in addition to the Stripe Fee.</p>\n<div id="attachment_18436" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/SellWPDashboard.png" rel="prettyphoto[18395]"><img class="size-large wp-image-18436" alt="SellWP Dashboard" src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/SellWPDashboard-500x251.png" width="500" height="251" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">SellWP Dashboard</p></div>\n<p>By outsourcing the product management side of the business, you&#8217;re counting on the fact the site will be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. If SellWP experiences downtime, it could result in lost sales. The site is hosted through <a title="http://fortrabbit.com/" href="http://fortrabbit.com/">Fortrabbit</a>, a service dedicated to providing developers great PHP hosting environments. SellWP is transparent about the fact that their uptime is dependent upon the uptime of Fortrabbit.</p>\n<h3>SellWP Takes Most Of The Worry Out Of Selling Products</h3>\n<p>Sellers don&#8217;t have to worry about being locked into the service since they can obtain CSV files containing customers, orders, licenses, products and coupons. The service also creates daily, weekly, and monthly backups hosted at an offsite location. SellWP takes care of SSL certificates by using CloudFlare&#8217;s flexible SSL certificate. This certificate is used to secure the seller&#8217;s shopping cart and membership areas. Back filling of customer data is not currently supported but will be available in an upcoming update.</p>\n<div id="attachment_18437" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/SellWPCouponManager.png" rel="prettyphoto[18395]"><img class="size-large wp-image-18437" alt="SellWP Coupon Manager" src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/SellWPCouponManager-500x140.png" width="500" height="140" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">SellWP Coupon Manager</p></div>\n<p>Turner compares SellWP to VaultPress in that both are managed solutions to a problem:</p>\n<blockquote><p>If you want WordPress backups you can use BackupBuddy, a self managed solution, or VaultPress a managed solution. SellWP is a managed solution for selling WordPress products.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I asked Turner if he will only allow GPLv2 or compatible licensed products to be sold through the site. His response: &#8220;<em>Yes, I believe in the GPL and intend to enforce it in the system.  The terms are actually from WordPress&#8217; boiler plate terms but this will be added once I get some time.</em>&#8221;</p>\n<p>If you want to see what the service looks like behind the scenes, watch the following video.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Try It Free Until April 1st</h3>\n<p>SellWP is another service in a long line of managed solutions for WordPress. I think what the service has to offer will appeal to a lot of developers, especially those who don&#8217;t already have an established system in place to sell their products. The service is free to try til <strong>April 1st, 2014</strong>. Once the beta ends, sellers will be charged the standard fees per transaction.</p>\n<p><strong>Does SellWP look like something you would use? Will existing sellers outsource this area of their business to a third party? Place any feedback you have in the comments as John Turner will be monitoring them to answer any questions you have.</strong></p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 06 Mar 2014 04:15:25 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:75:"WPTavern: Introducing Ex Astris: A Free WordPress Child Theme For Stargazer";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=18397";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:192:"http://wptavern.com/introducing-ex-astris-a-free-wordpress-child-theme-for-stargazer?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=introducing-ex-astris-a-free-wordpress-child-theme-for-stargazer";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3352:"<p>Last December, Jeff Chandler and I <a href="http://wptavern.com/wptavern-gets-responsive-with-new-design" target="_blank">updated WP Tavern</a> with a new design based on Theme Hybrid&#8217;s <a href="http://themehybrid.com/themes/stargazer" target="_blank">Stargazer</a> theme. Stargazer takes a <a href="http://wptavern.com/stargazer-a-free-design-specific-parent-theme-for-wordpress" target="_blank">new approach to parent/child themes</a> in that it houses the majority of both the design and functionality within the parent theme. The challenge is to make design changes in the child theme, without breaking the purpose of the parent theme.</p>\n<p>During the process of learning more about Stargazer, I created a child theme, which has now been approved for the WordPress Themes Directory. <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/ex-astris" target="_blank">Ex Astris</a> was designed with bloggers in mind, since blogging is what made me fall in love with WordPress in the first place.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/ex-astris.png" rel="prettyphoto[18397]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/ex-astris.png" alt="ex-astris" width="1600" height="1198" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18402" /></a></p>\n<p>You can customize the theme with your own header and background, if desired, but the example shown here does not utilize a custom header. The theme supports all of the site layouts found in the Stargazer parent theme and can also render them on a per-post basis:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1 Column Wide</li>\n<li>1 Column Narrow</li>\n<li>2 Columns: Content / Sidebar</li>\n<li>2 Columns: Sidebar / Content</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ex Astris is packaged with editor styles to help match the visual editor&#8217;s preview to the fonts and styles used within the theme. It supports all post formats and is translation-ready. By nature of being a child theme, it automatically includes all the features found in the Stargazer parent theme, ie. sticky posts, breadcrumbs, threaded comments, etc.</p>\n<p>Check out a <a href="http://untame.net/ex-astris/" target="_blank">live demo</a> of Ex Astris to see it in action.</p>\n<p>Originally, the theme was called Intrepid, but when I submitted it to WordPress.org, I found that there was already a theme with that name. <strong><em>Sidenote:</em></strong> Always check <a href="http://themes.svn.wordpress.org/" target="_blank">themes.svn.wordpress.org</a> before selecting a theme name if you intend to submit to the directory. Given that the directory now contains 2,366 themes, a name with two words in it is less likely to be taken.</p>\n<p>This was my first time going through the WordPress Theme Review process and I found that it&#8217;s actually fairly quick and easy for child themes.

Props go out to Weston Ruter and his team of dedicated developers who helped make this feature a reality.</p>\n<p>For those adventurous souls who have been testing the feature using the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-customizer/" target="_blank">Widget Customizer</a> plugin, you can now remove it and start testing it within the trunk.</p>\n<h3>No Changes Required From Theme Developers</h3>\n<p>Theme developers will not need to <a href="http://wptavern.com/widget-customizer-proposed-for-wordpress-3-9" target="_blank">add theme support for the customizer</a> to indicate a widget&#8217;s support for live previews, as this was <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/27112#comment:10" target="_blank">stripped from the version</a> of the plugin that was merged. Instead, the team opted to generalize this functionality so that any feature utilizing the customizer controls can do partial preview updates. Widgets still get live previews, but the window will refresh in an unobtrustve way as you make changes. Now that the widget customizer will soon be a native part of the WordPress publishing experience, WordPress users should be sure to <a href="http://wptavern.com/widget-customizer-approved-for-wordpress-3-9" target="_blank">read up</a> on all the capabilities it will add.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 05 Mar 2014 21:45:55 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:39:"Gravatar: A question for Gravatar users";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://blog.gravatar.com/?p=496";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:66:"http://blog.gravatar.com/2014/03/05/a-question-for-gravatar-users/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:622:"<p>We are working on a Gravatar mobile app and would like to ask our users:</p>\n<a name="pd_a_7853939"></a>\n<div class="PDS_Poll" id="PDI_container7853939"></div>\n<div id="PD_superContainer"></div>\n<a href="http://polldaddy.com/poll/7853939">Take Our Poll</a><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/gravatar.wordpress.com/496/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/gravatar.wordpress.com/496/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=blog.gravatar.com&blog=1886259&post=496&subd=gravatar&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 05 Mar 2014 20:25:56 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:14:"Toni Schneider";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:68:"WPTavern: How to Set Multiple Default Categories for WordPress Posts";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=18342";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:162:"http://wptavern.com/how-to-set-a-default-category-for-wordpress-posts?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=how-to-set-a-default-category-for-wordpress-posts";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3187:"<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/categories.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[18342]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/categories.jpg" alt="04.21.2011" width="900" height="418" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18362" /></a></p>\n<p>The &#8220;Uncategorized&#8221; category is a generic bin where WordPress posts go when you forget to assign a category. It&#8217;s rather irksome to discover that you&#8217;ve published a post as &#8220;Uncategorized,&#8221; since it doesn&#8217;t do much to connect your readers with more useful information on your blog.</p>\n<p>One easy solution to this problem is to edit the &#8220;Uncategorized&#8221; category slug in the admin at <strong>Posts > Categories</strong>. This is a decent option if you haven&#8217;t yet created any content. Another option is to set the default category at <strong>Settings > Writing</strong>. But what if you want to use multiple categories?</p>\n<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/default-category/" target="_blank">WordPress Default Category</a> is a simple plugin that lets you select category defaults for new posts. It allows you to select multiple categories to assign to uncategorized posts. With your selections in place, forgetting to categorize your post isn&#8217;t such a big deal because you can default it to be placed in one of your more general categories, such as &#8220;News&#8221; and &#8220;Tutorial&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Check out a live demo:</p>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/default-category.gif" rel="prettyphoto[18342]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/default-category.gif" alt="default-category" width="997" height="297" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18350" /></a></p>\n<h3>Multisite Compatible</h3>\n<p>This plugin was actually created for a multisite environment, though it works just fine on single WordPress installs as well. When network activated, it allows site administrators to select default categories for their own sites.</p>\n<p>The WordPress Default Category plugin was created by <a href="http://makea.kalawe.com/" target="_blank">Jason Kalawe</a>. When I asked him why he made the plugin, he said that it was originally part of a custom project. &#8220;This plug-in is an offshoot of a much larger custom plugin that auto-assigns categories based on the users&#8217; location in the world,&#8221; he said. Although he can&#8217;t share the original plugin due to its use of proprietary data, he thought the basic version would be useful to others using WordPress.</p>\n<p>Setting up a default category can help to enforce editorial standards for posts so that none get lost in the generic bin of uncategorized content. It can also be useful as a quick reference for content editors who aren&#8217;t regular contributors to a site.</p>\n<p>I tested the plugin and it works exactly as advertised. <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/default-category/" target="_blank">WordPress Default Category</a> is available for free from WordPress.org. This is one of those rare plugins that is potentially useful to the vast majority of WordPress websites that make use of categories.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 05 Mar 2014 18:47:04

class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18333" /></a></p>\n<p>UserPress is a new free plugin that aims to be the ultimate wiki solution for WordPress. It provides a comprehensive set of user-friendly features that will transform your site into a collaborative hub for creating wiki content.</p>\n<p>Richard Smith, the plugin&#8217;s author, created <a href="http://www.userpress.org/" target="_blank">UserPress</a> to provide functionality that he believes is often missing from existing wiki plugins. &#8220;Over the years, I have been frustrated by the lack of a proper wiki plugin for WordPress,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So I decided to build one.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Front-end Editing for Wiki Content</h3>\n<p>UserPress allows wiki users to create and edit content on the frontend of the site. Wiki participation privileges are based on user capabilities and can be manually set for each wiki.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/userpress.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[18117]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/userpress.jpg" alt="userpress" width="1420" height="896" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18295" /></a></p>\n<p>When creating new content, users will see a list of similar existing pages, which helps to prevent collaborators from overlapping on content. If a user accesses a non-existent wiki page, the plugin will prompt him to create a new page.</p>\n<p>UserPress includes multiple options for sorting and managing wiki articles, including recently added, recently edited, recently discussed and alphabetical order. The plugin also offers an array of wiki-related widgets: search, new wikis, popular wikis, recent wikis, categories and tags, a tag cloud, and a subscription button.</p>\n<h3>Wiki Version Control and Moderation</h3>\n<p>One of UserPress&#8217; more useful features is the built-in basic version control. The plugin allows users to compare changes to documents (diff) and gives the option for editors to attach a note with each revision.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/revisions.png" rel="prettyphoto[18117]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/revisions.png" alt="revisions" width="1430" height="1076" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18311" /></a></p>\n<p>UserPress allows wiki participants to moderate content using a set of customizable flags. For example, one might flag an article for poor attribution, readability or spam.</p>\n<h3>Subscription for bbPress and BuddyPress</h3>\n<p>The subscription feature allows users to monitor articles to keep track of comments and updates. However, subscription is only available for users on sites where bbPress and/or BuddyPress are activated.

UserPress includes a responsive default theme (“UserTheme”) that is automatically installed and activated once the plugin has been activated. However, the plugin will work with any WordPress theme. The automatic activation of the theme upon installation of the plugin helps users to discover that there is a theme available, but it might be disturbing if the administrator is not expecting it.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a wiki plugin that works well on its own and integrates nicely with bbPress and BuddyPress, UserPress is a solid option. Its feature set is geared towards making collaboration more efficient and productive for wiki participants. Download the plugin from <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/userpress/" target="_blank">WordPress.org</a> or grab the latest from the <a href="http://www.userpress.org/" target="_blank">UserPress homepage</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 05 Mar 2014 04:02:14 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:79:"WPTavern: CampusPress Launches Managed WordPress Hosting For Multisite Networks";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=18224";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:202:"http://wptavern.com/campuspress-launches-managed-wordpress-hosting-for-multisite-networks?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=campuspress-launches-managed-wordpress-hosting-for-multisite-networks";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7068:"<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/campuspress.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[18224]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/campuspress.jpg" alt="campuspress" width="1600" height="699" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18261" /></a></p>\n<p>Managed WordPress hosts are popping up all over the web. The platform is now so widely used that mammoth hosting providers such as <a href="http://wptavern.com/godaddy-launches-managed-wordpress-hosting-service" target="_blank">GoDaddy</a> and <a href="http://wptavern.com/mediatemple-launches-wordpress-managed-hosting-package" target="_blank">MediaTemple</a> have added specialized hosting packages dedicated to WordPress customers. WordPress hosting providers that cater to a specific niche are the latest trend.</p>\n<p><a href="http://campuspress.com/" target="_blank">CampusPress </a>is a newly branded managed host that specializes in WordPress multisite networks for educational organzations. It&#8217;s actually an offshoot of <a href="http://edublogs.org/" target="_blank">Edublogs</a>, the largest educational blogging host that has been providing multisite hosting since 2005. Due to the high demand for more CMS features, the Edublogs team decided to differentiate the services with CampusPress focused on providing multisite network hosting for schools and universities.</p>\n<p>I spoke with Edublogs Director of Operations, Ronnie Burt, to discuss the reasons for launching CampusPress as a separate entity into the managed hosting market. He said that many of the existing Edublogs customers wanted to use the service for more than blogs but were hesitant due to &#8220;blogs&#8221; within the name. &#8220;Since WordPress is all grown up and used for way more than blogging,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;re re-branding our Edublogs Campus service and really improving the network infrastructure and features to better support all types of sites.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>How Multisite Hosting Works at CampusPress</h3>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/osu.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[18224]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/osu.jpg" alt="osu" width="400" height="279" class="alignright size-full wp-image-18266" /></a>In addition to providing a hosting environment optimized for multisite networks, CampusPress accounts also include many built-in features specific to white labeling and managing a multisite network for education. A few examples include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Domain mapping</li>\n<li>Class and student management tools</li>\n<li>Content filtering and moderation</li>\n<li>Native apps for iOS and Android</li>\n<li>LDAP, Google Apps, Shibboleth and LTI authentication options</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I asked Burt if CampusPress is one giant network that manages all the multisite installations. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t technically networks within a network,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Each school has their own totally separate multisite install. We use SVN to manage WordPress core and our default plugins and themes across all of the networks.&#8221; CampusPress also provides a custom SVN folder for customers to submit and manage custom themes.</p>\n<p>The multisite hosting is truly managed in that the maintenance is handled professionally behind the scenes and customers do not have any server-level access such as FTP or the database. &#8220;This is how we can guarantee reliability and security,&#8221; Burt said. &#8220;While traditional managed hosting providers may have automated scans and a blacklist of plugins, we manually review line by line each line of code of every plugin and theme added to our networks.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>The Challenge of Keeping Pace With WordPress</h3>\n<p>Burt says that one of the biggest challenges of hosting multisite networks is performing upgrades. &#8220;Universities and schools often also have their own change management and branding policies and regulations,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They tend to not like upgrades or major changes in the middle of the school year, and they all seam to require different things when it comes to testing, timelines, and rolling out new plugins/tools.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For example, WordPress 3.8 introduced major changes to WordPress and many organizations didn&#8217;t want to have to re-educate their users in the middle of the school year. &#8220;This is especially a challenge when they get on different versions of WordPress core,&#8221; Burt explained. &#8220;It seems like as soon as we finally get everyone happily upgraded, another version will roll out and we&#8217;ll start the process all over again. We&#8217;d upgrade them all at the same time if they&#8217;d let us.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>CampusPress Expands Beyond Educational Blogs</h3>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/thereview.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[18224]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/thereview-300x245.jpg" alt="thereview" width="300" height="245" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-18269" /></a>With the new CampusPress branding in place, Burt and his team are able to expand beyond providing educational blogs. One of the largest categories includes news/magazine sites like, such as the <a href="http://blogs.du.edu/magazine/" target="_blank">University of Denver Magazine</a>. The other category they serve is faculty/department websites in need of CMS capabilities, such as the <a href="http://polisci.uoregon.edu/" target="_blank">University of Oregon Political Science Department</a> and <a href="http://mediarelations.cornell.edu/" target="_blank">Cornell&#8217;s Media Relations Office</a>.</p>\n<p>A few interesting examples of multisite networks already hosted with CampusPress include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://blogs.cornell.edu/gateshall/" target="_blank">Bill and Melinda Gates Hall</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://emergency.cornell.edu/" target="_blank">Cornell&#8217;s Emergency Site</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://udreview.com/" target="_blank">University of Delaware Student Newspaper</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://blogs.sjsu.edu/wsq" target="_blank">San Jose State&#8217;s Alumni Magazine</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://physics.uoregon.edu/" target="_blank">University of Oregon Department Sites</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://u.osu.edu/ohiostatedrumline/" target="_blank">Ohio State&#8217;s Drumline</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>WordPress use is on the rise in the education sector.  &#8220;The buzz around WordPress at the conferences we attend and the <a href="http://lists.automattic.com/mailman/listinfo/wp-edu" target="_blank">WP in Education mailing list</a> suggests a growth that parallels WordPress in business and other arenas,&#8221; Burt said. With the re-branded <a href="http://campuspress.com/" target="_blank">CampusPress</a> website launched this week, Edublogs is officially entering the managed WordPress hosting market. The company joins <a href="http://wptavern.com/cart66-launches-wordpress-managed-hosting-for-e-commerce" target="_blank">Cart66</a> as one of the first managed WordPress hosts catering to a specific niche.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 04 Mar 2014 22:32:58 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:"type";i:128;s:7:"headers";a:9:{s:6:"server";s:5:"nginx";s:4:"date";s:29:"Sun, 16 Mar 2014 18:52:07 GMT";s:12:"content-type";s:8:"text/xml";s:14:"content-length";s:6:"207645";s:10:"connection";s:5:"close";s:4:"vary";s:15:"Accept-Encoding";s:13:"last-modified";s:29:"Sun, 16 Mar 2014 18:45:14 GMT";s:4:"x-nc";s:11:"HIT lax 250";s:13:"accept-ranges";s:5:"bytes";}s:5:"build";s:14:"20130911120210";}', 'no');

While learning how to build a custom content management system, he stumbled upon WordPress and started fiddling around with it to learn more about its features. At the age of 14, he landed his first client. WordPress ticked all the boxes for the client’s requirements and Sunny launched his career as a professional WordPress developer. Sunny Ratilal Fast forward to three years later, Sunny is now 17 years old and currently in Sixth Form in London. When not busy studying, he enjoys developing custom plugins for clients and is also a prolific contributor to Easy Digital Downloads, having logged an impressive 1,097 commits to the codebase. Learning By Contributing to Open Source Projects While contributing to EDD, Sunny said he has learned a great deal about working in remote teams. “Working alongside EDD developers, we’re scattered all around the World!  Some are based in the US, England and even New Zealand! Remote teams are fantastic because it always means someone is around whatever time of the day.” Getting involved in EDD changed Sunny’s life and opened him up to a new world of collaboration. “Open source software has empowered me to code,” he said. “Contributing to EDD was my first open source project which gave me confidence to contribute to other smaller plugins and then eventually WordPress Core, submitting my first patch to WordPress last year.” Since his first foray into commercial products involved building extensions for a popular plugin, I asked Sunny if he has any advice to others who want to be successful in that space. He said: Don’t build the extension because it’s something that’s required, build it because you want to build it. Build something you’re really passionate about; that’s what’ll give you the most pleasure whilst coding it. The key to success is not all about marketing the plugin, it’s about how the plugin is written. Sunny advises developers to keep it clean and simple. He offered five tips for building extensions:  Write clean code Document it very well Make the code efficient, don’t have hundreds of WP_Query instances or load hundreds of JavaScript/CSS files. Don’t give the customers a chance to complain, have a feature list built and always beta test Provide excellent support to all customers  The Importance of WordPress Role Models While learning and working with WordPress, Sunny said that having good role models inspired him to further develop his skills. “I have three very important role models: all three are fellow WordPress developers: Tom McFarlin, Pippin Williamson and Mark Jaquith,” he said. “They are exceptional developers who have a myriad of knowledge. The plugins/themes they create are made with other developers in mind and their coding is by far some of the best you will ever see.” Sunny is hoping to advance his skills along the same path he’s seen forged by the aforementioned developers. “I can say with a great amount of certainty that you can learn something new from every single commit to plugins/themes/WordPress Tom, Mark and Pippin make.” As is the case in many technical professions, Sunny has learned the most by doing and by watching other high performing developers. A Bright Future for Sunny Ratilal What does the future hold for Sunny Ratilal? He’s got one more year before entering university. Meanwhile, he is studying Mathematics, Further Mathematics, Computer Science and Physics. He hopes to study Computer Science at University. He also plans to continue his work with EDD and WordPress. At the moment, he’s taking a break from EDD contributions to focus on his schoolwork. Pursuing a career in WordPress is something he’s considered, and he plans to continue developing while getting his education. “I love building WordPress plugins and themes and have no intention to stop doing so,” he said. In many ways Sunny Ratilal seems ahead of his time, with his mature knowledge of teamwork, building software and handling customers. Code mentors have made all the difference for him and his experiences highlight the importance of solid role models in the WordPress community. Though you may often feel like you’re working alone in your small corner of the world, the quality of the code you produce and your interactions with other developers may actually be mentoring future WordPress professionals. A developer who works to help others learn and grow can be instrumental in swinging the doors open for newcomers to the WordPress community.''>WPTavern: The Importance of Mentors: How a High School Student Became a Professional WordPress Developer</a></li></ul></div><div class="rss-widget"><ul><li class=''dashboard-news-plugin''><span>Popular Plugin:</span> <a href=''http://wordpress.org/plugins/captcha/'' class=''dashboard-news-plugin-link''>Captcha</a></h5>&nbsp;<span>(<a href=''plugin-install.php?tab=plugin-information&amp;plugin=captcha&amp;_wpnonce=3f3df7d228&amp;TB_iframe=true&amp;width=600&amp;height=800'' class=''thickbox'' title=''Captcha''>Install</a>)</span></li></ul></div>', 'no'),

He served as Attorney General for the Province of Alberta from 1921 to 1925 and as Premier from 1925 to 1934. Undoubtedly Mr. Brownlee''s most significant achievement as Premier was negotiating the transfer of ownership of natural resources from federal to provincial ownership. After leaving public life in 1935, Mr. Brownlee re-established his law practice in Edmonton. Mr. Brownlee''s strong work ethic, dedication to community and public service, and commitment to legal writing and speaking are part of the present firm''s tradition.\r\n\r\nWhile in office as Premier, Mr. Brownlee had the vision, as well as the considerable determination, to seek out, negotiate and secure the transfer of ownership of natural resources from the government of Canada to the Province of Alberta.

This dedication to protecting the rights and interests of those he represented has shaped Brownlee LLP as much as it has shaped the Province of Alberta as we now know it. Just as John E. Brownlee''s passion and innovation eventually expanded beyond the boundaries of Alberta, so too has the passion, innovation and impact of Brownlee LLP continued to expand.

He commenced his articles in Calgary in 1909 and from the time of his call to the Alberta Bar built a successful law practice. He served as Attorney General for the Province of Alberta from 1921 to 1925 and as Premier from 1925 to 1934. Undoubtedly Mr. Brownlee''s most significant achievement as Premier was negotiating the transfer of ownership of natural resources from federal to provincial ownership. After leaving public life in 1935, Mr. Brownlee re-established his law practice in Edmonton. Mr. Brownlee''s strong work ethic, dedication to community and public service, and commitment to legal writing and speaking are part of the present firm''s tradition.\r\n\r\nWhile in office as Premier, Mr. Brownlee had the vision, as well as the considerable determination, to seek out, negotiate and secure the transfer of ownership of natural resources from the government of Canada to the Province of Alberta. This important event has resulted in the level of prosperity Albertans enjoy, and today and will share with generations to come.\r\n\r\nWhether performing his roles and responsibilities as Attorney General, Member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta, Premier of Alberta, President and General Manager of the United Grain Growers of Alberta, or the head of the law firm he built, John E.

He served as Attorney General for the Province of Alberta from 1921 to 1925 and as Premier from 1925 to 1934. Undoubtedly Mr. Brownlee''s most significant achievement as Premier was negotiating the transfer of ownership of natural resources from federal to provincial ownership. After leaving public life in 1935, Mr. Brownlee re-established his law practice in Edmonton. Mr. Brownlee''s strong work ethic, dedication to community and public service, and commitment to legal writing and speaking are part of the present firm''s tradition.\r\n\r\nWhile in office as Premier, Mr. Brownlee had the vision, as well as the considerable determination, to seek out, negotiate and secure the transfer of ownership of natural resources from the government of Canada to the Province of Alberta. This important event has resulted in the level of prosperity Albertans enjoy, and today and will share with generations to come.\r\n\r\nWhether performing his roles and responsibilities as Attorney General, Member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta, Premier of Alberta, President and General Manager of the United Grain Growers of Alberta, or the head of the law firm he built, John E. Brownlee was and remained a student of the law and a dedicated representative and voice for others. This dedication to protecting the rights and interests of those he represented has shaped Brownlee LLP as much as it has shaped the Province of Alberta as we now know it. Just as John E.

Through this continuous dedication to local issues, the Municipal Helpline has developed into an indispensable value-added service that is made available with no strings attached. It offers risk management through sound consultation and guidance, based upon unparalleled experience, resulting in risk avoidance. It defines what we call the "municipal relationship."\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe Municipal Helpline is an informal consultation service offered free of charge to Alberta Municipalities, and those of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut, as well as quasi-municipal entities such as regional services commissions, municipal corporations, and authorities. The Municipal Helpline is offered through either our toll-free telephone service, or through direct e-mail contact, for the purposes of assisting in the avoidance of further or potentially larger legal problems:\r\n\r\nNo solicitor-client relationship is created by or pursuant to the Municipal Helpline, and consequently no legal fee or other charge applies to such inquiries.\r\n\r\nThe consultation offered under the Municipal Helpline is limited to questions and inquiries that can generally be addressed over the phone, and more often than not the consultation and guidance is also provided verbally over the phone. The service does not provide formal legal opinions, and does not include the drafting or review of documents or conduct of legal research. Requests made under the service can, however, cover any and all issues impacting municipalities, as well as topics which engage any aspects of the municipal and other legal experience and expertise of our lawyers. The service may include consultation and discussion of any topics applicable to our practice areas including, without restriction:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>strict legal concepts including statutory, common law, and administrative law concepts.</li>\r\n	<li>municipal best practices not just know-how, but knowing how to do it better.</li>\r\n	<li>procedures and decision making appropriate process and procedures, and the operation and exercise of the decision making powers of Council itself.</li>\r\n	<li>administrative law including general advocacy and prosecution, Subdivision and Development Appeal Board practice, procedure and decision making, and general counsel to various administrative boards and tribunals.</li>\r\n	<li>municipal authority including authority under legislation, bylaw or resolution.</li>\r\n	<li>municipal legislation proper drafting of municipal bylaws, policies and resolutions.</li>\r\n	<li>land use, planning and development including proper land use bylaws, general planning issues, proper permit and approval conditions, development agreements, and off-site levies and other cost recoveries.</li>\r\n	<li>municipal incorporations creating and operating commissions, municipal corporations and societies.</li>\r\n	<li>commercial contracts and transactions, municipal borrowing, municipal land development, leasing, purchases and sales lands, buildings and businesses, and public-private partnerships.</li>\r\n	<li>labour and employment wrongful and constructive dismissals, human rights complaints, reorganizations and employment contracts, risk management and best practices.</li>\r\n	<li>public utilities both regulated and non-regulated aspects of all manner of public utilities.</li>\r\n	<li>municipal enforcement including municipal bylaw enforcement and prosecutions, planning and development enforcement, and all manner of other municipal enforcement.</li>\r\n	<li>environmental law risk management, defense from prosecutions, general liability, and best practices.</li>\r\n	<li>referrals to additional resources that may be utilized daily by Brownlee LLP in the representation of the interests of municipalities, and the issues that impact them.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe Municipal Helpline is not a legal service: it is a support network for municipalities and related entities, and an integral part of any success strategy. It is part and parcel with the relationship that Brownlee LLP has always had with municipalities and their related entities. We are committed to ensuring the success of this service, and more importantly the success of our municipal colleagues. We encourage you to take advantage of the Municipal Helpline as another essential tool for achieving all manner of goals and initiatives.\r\n\r\nIn the case of topics or issues that are of a more serious nature, or that cannot be appropriately handled by way of an informal verbal consultation, we would be pleased to a discuss more formal retainer in order to provide specific legal advice, opinion or action.'),

Through this continuous dedication to local issues, the Municipal Helpline has developed into an indispensable value-added service that is made available with no strings attached. It offers risk management through sound consultation and guidance, based upon unparalleled experience, resulting in risk avoidance. It defines what we call the "municipal relationship."\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe Municipal Helpline is an informal consultation service offered free of charge to Alberta Municipalities, and those of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut, as well as quasi-municipal entities such as regional services commissions, municipal corporations, and authorities. The Municipal Helpline is offered through either our toll-free telephone service, or through direct e-mail contact, for the purposes of assisting in the avoidance of further or potentially larger legal problems:\r\n\r\nNo solicitor-client relationship is created by or pursuant to the Municipal Helpline, and consequently no legal fee or other charge applies to such inquiries.\r\n\r\nThe consultation offered under the Municipal Helpline is limited to questions and inquiries that can generally be addressed over the phone, and more often than not the consultation and guidance is also provided verbally over the phone. The service does not provide formal legal opinions, and does not include the drafting or review of documents or conduct of legal research. Requests made under the service can, however, cover any and all issues impacting municipalities, as well as topics which engage any aspects of the municipal and other legal experience and expertise of our lawyers. The service may include consultation and discussion of any topics applicable to our practice areas including, without restriction:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>strict legal concepts including statutory, common law, and administrative law concepts.</li>\r\n	<li>municipal best practices not just know-how, but knowing how to do it better.</li>\r\n	<li>procedures and decision making appropriate process and procedures, and the operation and exercise of the decision making powers of Council itself.</li>\r\n	<li>administrative law including general advocacy and prosecution, Subdivision and Development Appeal Board practice, procedure and decision making, and general counsel to various administrative boards and tribunals.</li>\r\n	<li>municipal authority including authority under legislation, bylaw or resolution.</li>\r\n	<li>municipal legislation proper drafting of municipal bylaws, policies and resolutions.</li>\r\n	<li>land use, planning and development including proper land use bylaws, general planning issues, proper permit and approval conditions, development agreements, and off-site levies and other cost recoveries.</li>\r\n	<li>municipal incorporations creating and operating commissions, municipal corporations and societies.</li>\r\n	<li>commercial contracts and transactions, municipal borrowing, municipal land development, leasing, purchases and sales lands, buildings and businesses, and public-private partnerships.</li>\r\n	<li>labour and employment wrongful and constructive dismissals, human rights complaints, reorganizations and employment contracts, risk management and best practices.</li>\r\n	<li>public utilities both regulated and non-regulated aspects of all manner of public utilities.</li>\r\n	<li>municipal enforcement including municipal bylaw enforcement and prosecutions, planning and development enforcement, and all manner of other municipal enforcement.</li>\r\n	<li>environmental law risk management, defense from prosecutions, general liability, and best practices.</li>\r\n	<li>referrals to additional resources that may be utilized daily by Brownlee LLP in the representation of the interests of municipalities, and the issues that impact them.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe Municipal Helpline is not a legal service: it is a support network for municipalities and related entities, and an integral part of any success strategy. It is part and parcel with the relationship that Brownlee LLP has always had with municipalities and their related entities. We are committed to ensuring the success of this service, and more importantly the success of our municipal colleagues. We encourage you to take advantage of the Municipal Helpline as another essential tool for achieving all manner of goals and initiatives.\r\n\r\nIn the case of topics or issues that are of a more serious nature, or that cannot be appropriately handled by way of an informal verbal consultation, we would be pleased to a discuss more formal retainer in order to provide specific legal advice, opinion or action.'),

He commenced his articles in Calgary in 1909 and from the time of his call to the Alberta Bar built a successful law practice. He served as Attorney General for the Province of Alberta from 1921 to 1925 and as Premier from 1925 to 1934. Undoubtedly Mr. Brownlee''s most significant achievement as Premier was negotiating the transfer of ownership of natural resources from federal to provincial ownership. After leaving public life in 1935, Mr. Brownlee re-established his law practice in Edmonton. Mr. Brownlee''s strong work ethic, dedication to community and public service, and commitment to legal writing and speaking are part of the present firm''s tradition.\r\n\r\nWhile in office as Premier, Mr. Brownlee had the vision, as well as the considerable determination, to seek out, negotiate and secure the transfer of ownership of natural resources from the government of Canada to the Province of Alberta. This important event has resulted in the level of prosperity Albertans enjoy, and today and will share with generations to come.\r\n\r\nWhether performing his roles and responsibilities as Attorney General, Member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta, Premier of Alberta, President and General Manager of the United Grain Growers of Alberta, or the head of the law firm he built, John E. Brownlee was and remained a student of the law and a dedicated representative and voice for others. This dedication to protecting the rights and interests of those he represented has shaped Brownlee LLP as much as it has shaped the Province of Alberta as we now know it. Just as John E. Brownlee''s passion and innovation eventually expanded beyond the boundaries of Alberta, so too has the passion, innovation and impact of Brownlee LLP continued to expand. Today, our lawyers traverse Western Canada including the Territories on a daily basis, carrying on the traditions and building upon the innovations of John E. Brownlee.'),

Through this continuous dedication to local issues, the Municipal Helpline has developed into an indispensable value-added service that is made available with no strings attached. It offers risk management through sound consultation and guidance, based upon unparalleled experience, resulting in risk avoidance. It defines what we call the "municipal relationship."\r\n\r\nThe Municipal Helpline is an informal consultation service offered free of charge to Alberta Municipalities, and those of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut, as well as quasi-municipal entities such as regional services commissions, municipal corporations, and authorities. The Municipal Helpline is offered through either our toll-free telephone service, or through direct e-mail contact, for the purposes of assisting in the avoidance of further or potentially larger legal problems:\r\n\r\nNo solicitor-client relationship is created by or pursuant to the Municipal Helpline, and consequently no legal fee or other charge applies to such inquiries.\r\n\r\nThe consultation offered under the Municipal Helpline is limited to questions and inquiries that can generally be addressed over the phone, and more often than not the consultation and guidance is also provided verbally over the phone. The service does not provide formal legal opinions, and does not include the drafting or review of documents or conduct of legal research. Requests made under the service can, however, cover any and all issues impacting municipalities, as well as topics which engage any aspects of the municipal and other legal experience and expertise of our lawyers.

This client-centred philosophy allows our lawyers to more quickly become experts in each of their chosen fields and be constantly engaged and invested in their work and interests, and also ensures that lawyers are not required to "dabble" in other areas of the law in order to meet clients'' needs. Because more traditional approaches to legal businesses often measure a lawyer''s worth to the firm by the clients he or she keeps or keeps happy, that lawyer may be and often is expected, motivated, or even required by the circumstances to meet <em>all </em>needs of the clients, and may consequently become a jack-of-all-trades for the clients.

Our practice areas have developed both in anticipation of and in response to clients’ needs, so each practice area quickly becomes sustainable based on existing clients.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>OUR CLIENTS</h3>\r\nLike many regional firms in western Canada, our clients range from individuals, to large and small businesses, to municipal and Provincial governments, to multi-national corporations. However, Brownlee’s primary strength comes from being retained by “institutional” clients on an ongoing and historical basis, rather than individuals. This creates a robust foundation for legal practices, as well as a balanced base of large, small, local, regional and international clients that is stable and sustainable and which, frankly, belies our size and location. At Brownlee, we have the practice areas and clients akin to a national firm, but with the distinct advantages of a regional firm. To this end, some of our fundamental client groups include the following:\r\n<strong>Insurance Companies:</strong>  As a result of our work with many leading insurers, much of our firm’s litigation practice is “defence” oriented. Brownlee is an affiliate member of the Canadian Litigation Counsel, a nationwide affiliation of independent insurance defence law firms. The Canadian Litigation Counsel is, in turn, affiliated with the Harmonie Group, a similar organization encompassing the United States and Europe. These types of affiliations provide Brownlee with a national and international presence without sacrificing the regional firm benefits of in-house decision-making;\r\n<strong>Municipalities and the Province of Alberta:</strong>  Brownlee represents most municipalities in Alberta, as well as many municipalities throughout the Yukon, Northwest Territories and Nunavut. Our firm has also been pleased to advise and represent the Province of Alberta on a variety of important issues and to litigate those issues at various levels of Courts. This has included constitutional references throughout Alberta and in neighbouring provinces at all levels of Court, including the Supreme Court of Canada;\r\n<strong>Commercial Lenders:  </strong>Brownlee operates one of the largest commercial lending practices in western Canada.   Our lender clients include chartered banks, life insurance companies and major pension funds. In addition, we frequently provide advice to borrowers relating to the negotiation and structuring of credit facilities with their lenders;\r\n<strong>Corporate/Commercial Institutions and Businesses:  </strong>In addition to commercial lenders, we serve a wide group of corporate and commercial clients including sole proprietors, partnerships, Alberta business corporations, co-operative associations, First Nations’ business vehicles, business corporations from outside of Alberta, Alberta and Federal non-profit organizations, as well as publicly traded companies and corporations that are established by specific provincial or federal statutes; and\r\n<strong>Alberta Schools, School Divisions and Post-secondary Institutions:  </strong>Our firm represents many of Alberta''s public and separate school divisions, as well as private and charter schools.

On occasion, the firm is retained to undertake municipal-based bylaw prosecutions and to give counsel in inter-governmental and jurisdictional dispute matters. Our firm is also becoming progressively more involved in Environmental, Health, Aboriginal, and Privacy and Access to Information law;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Administrative Law</strong>, consisting of all aspects of administrative law in Alberta and neighbouring jurisdictions.

From my very earliest days with the firm, I was provided with the support, guidance and opportunities to become not only a skilled lawyer, but a better person. I share a work ethic and business philosophy with my partners and associates that have resulted not only in harmonious working relationships, but also close personal friendships as well. I feel privileged to be a lawyer at Brownlee, and look forward to spending the rest of my working days with the firm.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.brownleelaw.com/index.php?option=com_sobi2&amp;sobi2Task=sobi2Details&amp;catid=35&amp;sobi2Id=53&amp;Itemid=49">John C. McDonnell</a>\r\n\r\nPartner (Corporate/Commercial), Husband, Father to three children, Chairperson of the City of St. Albert Subdivision and Development Appeal Board, and Soccer Coach.\r\n\r\nI work in the Business department at Brownlee. My primary focus is on providing corporate governance advice to municipalities regarding inter-municipal service projects. Additionally, I also have a significant practice in commercial real estate and general corporate/commercial work.\r\n\r\nUnlike most other people at Brownlee, I didn''t article at Brownlee. I graduated from Law school in 2000, articled at a mid-sized Edmonton firm, and worked there until 2004. I then joined another mid-sized law firm and worked there for just over a year. I joined Brownlee in 2005, about five years after graduating from Law school at the University of Alberta. After working at three different firms, I can definitely say that Brownlee has the right mix of firm culture, people, clients and challenging work that I was looking for. I''ll stay at Brownlee until the day I retire!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a title="Jill Sheward" href="http://www.brownleelaw.com/index.php?option=com_sobi2&amp;sobi2Task=sobi2Details&amp;catid=35&amp;sobi2Id=57&amp;Itemid=49">Jill Sheward</a>\r\n\r\nAssociate (Commercial/Municipal Real Estate, Lending, Leasing), Vice Chair (Governance) of Junior Achievement of Northern Alberta &amp; NWT, Director of Edmonton CREW Association, CBA Mentor and Brownlee LLP Summer Student Mentor\r\n\r\nI graduated from the Faculty of Law at the University of Alberta in 2005, articled with the firm and have proudly been with Brownlee LLP ever since.\r\n\r\nMy practice consists of matters relating to commercial real estate and involves all aspects of commercial property transactions, including the acquisition, disposition and financing of commercial real estate, and leasing of office, industrial and retail space (for both landlords and tenants). I am also involved in municipal commercial transactions including acquisitions, dispositions, leasing, rights-of-way, easements and restrictive covenants. The firm has provided the mentorship and support necessary to continue to grow my practice into more complex areas, and really ensures that all the lawyers feel as valued members of the Brownlee team.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a title="Kristjana Kellgren Bio" href="http://www.brownleelaw.com/index.php?option=com_sobi2&amp;sobi2Task=sobi2Details&amp;catid=35&amp;sobi2Id=47&amp;Itemid=49">Kristjana E. Kellgren</a>\r\n\r\nAssociate (Municipal, Administrative and Regulatory Law), Wife, Volunteer with Edmonton Community Legal Centre, Former CBA Mentor, and Brownlee LLP Summer Student Junior Mentor.\r\n\r\nAfter attending the University of Alberta for my undergraduate degree, I moved to Halifax, NS to attend Dalhousie (now Schulich) law school. After summering with Brownlee after my first year of law school, I was convinced that it was the place for me, and I happily accepted an articling position. I graduated from Dalhousie in 2008, moved back to Edmonton, articled with Brownlee thereafter and have been an associate in the firm’s Municipal Department since my admission to the Law Society of Alberta in August, 2009.\r\n\r\nUntil my rotation in the Municipal Department during my articles, I would have told you that administrative law was my least favourite area of the law (no offence to my admin law professor, of course!) But, thanks to Brownlee’s formal rotation program and the experiences I had working with some inspiring mentors, I discovered a practice area where now I could not imagine doing anything else. It was truly a case where my impression of something in law school couldn’t have been more different than my experience with that thing in practice, but without being part of Brownlee’s formal rotation and being exposed to the practice of administrative law, I would never have known the difference!\r\n\r\nMy practice focuses on advocacy on behalf of municipalities, government agencies and other public entities before administrative tribunals, with a focus on utility-related matters before the Alberta Utilities Commission. I also assist and represent municipalities and other, mostly public, corporations in contract disputes and various other non-insured litigation-related matters.\r\n\r\nI wouldn’t have the experience or confidence in my legal practice that I do today were it not for the mentorship I received (and continue to receive) at Brownlee and in being provided with exciting and challenging opportunities every step of the way. Just as important, however, I work alongside colleagues (partners, other associates, students and staff from all of Brownlee’s departments) that I respect and consider my friends. It is the collegial, friendly and dynamic atmosphere that first drew me to the firm as a summer student and it remains one of the biggest reasons why I am so pleased to continue my career at Brownlee.', 'Who sits on our Edmonton Articling Committee?', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '268-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-03-14 05:33:46', '2014-03-14 05:33:46', '', 268, 'http://localhost/brownlee/?p=269', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Here are some of the tried-and-true strategies based on our own experience, from our current students who recently interviewed to those who sit on our Articling Committee:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>Before Interview Week</h3>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThroughout law school, try to meet as many lawyers as possible to get a sense of each firm. Do your research: explore their websites, attend their presentations or lectures, and so forth.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBe realistic about the type of firm you want to work at. The reality is that you do not have time to interview at every firm, of every size, and in every city. While it is good to cast a wide net and meet lots of people, be practical at the same time.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThere are legitimate reasons for interviewing in both Edmonton and Calgary, or other places as well. However, before you get to Interview Week, we recommend that you get to the heart of why you''re interviewing so broadly. If the only reason for interviewing in more than one city is to increase the chances of getting an articling position, we recommend that you narrow down your search. All firms want to know that you have chosen them for the long-term, and if you lack some kind of connection to the area, every firm will be concerned (rightly or wrongly) that you''re not committed.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSubmit your applications in advance of each firm''s deadline. The sooner they receive your application, the sooner they''ll book your interview. If you wait until the last minute, your favourite firm may already be booked solid, or close to it.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhen a lawyer or staff member contacts you to schedule an interview, remember that your interview starts with that phone call. The first impression you leave can mean a lot.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nTry to schedule your first interviews on Monday or Tuesday of Interview Week, so you allow yourself time to attend second interviews during the end of the week.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nConsider scheduling the firm you are least certain about first. While you should take the interview seriously, you can use it as a "warm-up".  And try not to schedule more than 4 – 5 interviews per day. It''s too much. You''ll be exhausted.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhen scheduling your interviews, ask the firms how long their interviews usually run. (Our interviews are about 45 minutes in length.)  Keep in mind that most firms will invite you to tour the rest of the office with a current articling student or junior associate after your interview, so budget in this time when scheduling your subsequent interviews.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>During Interview Week</h3>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAfter each interview, take a moment to jot down a few notes: Who did you meet? What was your impression? What made that firm different from the others? At the end of the day, sit down and review your notes to determine if your impressions justification have changed, and to consider whether any new questions or issues have come up that you may want to follow-up on.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFollow-up with the firms you liked. Don''t be shy about sending an email or making a phone call to someone you met. With that said, be sincere. We all know that not every firm is your first choice, so don''t tell us otherwise unless you mean it!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSome firms schedule interviews over the lunch hour. Sometimes it''s a matter of making full use of the day, and sometimes it''s a matter of wooing you. Regardless, keep your lunch hours flexible!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBy the end of the week, if you are honest with yourself, there will be one firm that really stands out to you. We strongly encourage students to pick up the phone, and candidly tell that firm where you stand (even if it''s not us). We appreciate that it is a scary call to make. However, the reality is that given a handful of candidates that we would love to hire, our positions most often go to the students that we know feel the same.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWe don''t recommend telling firms that you''re not interested (best to keep a few doors open, of course), but you will greatly improve the chances of making a mutually agreeable match if you are open and honest. Similarly, don''t tell more than one firm that they are your top pick. Not only do firms talk amongst themselves, but being dishonest is the wrong way to start your career.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>Call Day</h3>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nPrior to Call Day, ensure that the firms you are most interested in know exactly how to reach you. If you will be waiting by your home phone with your cell in the other hand, tell the firms in advance exactly how to reach you.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nStay calm. Sometimes the phone doesn''t ring at 8:00 a.m. sharp simply because there are more students than there are lawyers to make the calls.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf you do not receive an offer, don''t be afraid to pick up the phone and call firms (but perhaps not too soon after 8:00 a.m.). If they''ve filled their positions, at least you''ll know. If they haven''t filled their positions yet, they may be very happy to hear that you''re interested.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhat if your 2nd choice of firms calls before your 1st choice? If you have been honest with firms from the beginning, it is most likely that your 1st choice will call first. (Keep in mind, it doesn''t matter how many offers you get. What matters is getting the right offer.)  However, if your 2nd choice calls first, don''t be afraid to ask for a few minutes to consider the offer (you have until 12:00 p.m. the next day), and use the time to call your 1st choice to determine if they''ve filled their positions. With that said, try not to leave that other firm hanging because their 2nd, 3rd, and 4th choices are all being snapped up by other firms with each passing second.</li>\r\n</ul>', 'What should you expect during Articling Interview Week?', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'what-should-you-expect-during-articling-interview-week', '', '', '2014-03-14 05:35:36', '2014-03-14 05:35:36', '', 0, 'http://localhost/brownlee/?post_type=career_links&#038;p=272', 11, 'career_links', '', 0),
